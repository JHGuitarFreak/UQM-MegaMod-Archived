#(PRECURSOR STARBASE)
			---- REPORT FROM ORBIT ----

WE HAVE FOUND THE REMAINS OF THE PRECURSOR STARBASE.

OUR XENOTECHS ARE AMAZED THAT THERE IS EVEN ANYTHING HERE TO EXPLORE. THIS PLACE WAS PICKED CLEAN BY ALLIANCE SCIENTISTS BOTH BEFORE AND DURING THE WAR, AND WHEN THE UR-QUAN CAME THROUGH HERE THEY NUKED WHAT THEY COULDN'T CART OFF FOR THEMSELVES.  

FORTUNATELY, THE PRECURSORS BUILT IT A BIT TOUGHER THAN THAT.

UNFORTUNATELY, NOT THAT MUCH TOUGHER. THIS PLACE HAS REALLY BEEN WORKED OVER, THE LANDING PLATFORM WE'RE USING IS UNSTABLE, AND IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO LOOK AROUND MUCH MORE.  

RETURNING TO THE SHIP.

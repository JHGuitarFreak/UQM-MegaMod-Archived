     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

THESE RUINS APPEAR TO BE REMNANTS OF COLONY WORLDS FROM A NEARBY CIVILIZATION KNOWN AS THE `ZOQ-FOT-PIK'.

THE COLONIES APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THEIR HOMEWORLD UP UNTIL THE POINT OF THEIR DESTRUCTION, WHICH THEIR RECORDS SHOW WAS THE RESULT OF AN UNPROVOKED SURPRISE ATTACK FROM AN UNKNOWN RACE.

THERE ARE NO SURVIVORS.

        ---- END OF REPORT ----

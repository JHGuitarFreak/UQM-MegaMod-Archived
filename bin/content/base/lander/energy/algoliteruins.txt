#(ALGOLITES 1)
			---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

WE'VE FOUND THE RUINS OF A CIVILIZATION CALLED THE ALGOLITES. WHICH IS AMAZING CONSIDERING THIS PLANET HAS ZERO ATMOSPHERE.

WE'RE BEGINNING TO TRANSLATE THE RECORDS WE'VE FOUND AND IT SEEMS THE SPATHI CAME HERE AT SOME POINT, BUT THEN THE HISTORY ENDS AS ABRUPTLY AS THEY ARRIVED.

WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO MAKE OF IT BUT OUR INSTRUMENTS SHOW THE ATMOSPHERE WAS STRIPPED AWAY NOT LONG AFTER THE SPATHI SHOWED UP.

WE'RE GOING TO CATALOG WHAT WE'VE FOUND AND HEAD BACK TO THE LANDER.

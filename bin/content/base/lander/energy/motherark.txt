#(MOTHER_ARK 1)
			---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

WE HAVE UNCOVERED WHAT LOOKS TO BE WHAT'S LEFT OF THE MMRNMHRM MOTHER-ARK. WE CAN FIND NO OTHER EVIDENCE OF MMRNMHRM COLONIZATION, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS PLANET WAS THEIR BASE OF OPERATIONS.
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MMRNMHRM BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY PICKED UP THEIR ENTIRE CIVILIZATION AND MOVED IT OFF-WORLD.

AT THIS POINT, THE MOTHER-ARK IS SIMPLY ALIEN JUNK. NOTHING OF VALUE HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND EXCEPT FOR THE ARK ITSELF. EVEN THEN IT'S ONLY WORTH IS FOR STUDYING OR USING IT AS METAL SCRAP.

WE HAVE MADE HOLOS OF EVERYTHING AND ARE RETURNING TO THE LANDER.

     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

IN THE VUX COMMANDER'S MENAGERIE WE HAVE FOUND WHAT APPEARS TO BE FUNCTIONING CRYOTANKS CONTAINING A DOZEN BIPEDAL CREATURES. WE CAN'T BE SURE, BUT THROUGH THE TANK'S FOGGED VIEWPORTS WE THINK WE CAN SEE YOUNG SHOFIXTI FEMALES INSIDE THE FREEZER UNITS. WE HAVE TRANSFERRED THE CRYOTANKS TO THE LANDER AND ARE RETURNING TO THE SHIP.

        ---- END OF REPORT ----

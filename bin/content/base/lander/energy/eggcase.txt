#(EGGCASE 1)
     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

NEAR AN UNUSUAL VOLCANIC FUMAROLE, WE HAVE FOUND A FRAGMENT OF SOME KIND OF BIOLOGICAL ENCASEMENT OR SHELL WHICH IS MADE OF AN INCREDIBLY TOUGH, HEAT- RESISTANT MAT OF FUNGAL FIBERS.

WE CAN FIND NO SIGN OF ANY LIFEFORM WHICH MAY HAVE `HATCHED' FROM THIS EGG SHELL, BUT WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE FLAGSHIP FOR FURTHER STUDY.

        ---- END OF REPORT ----

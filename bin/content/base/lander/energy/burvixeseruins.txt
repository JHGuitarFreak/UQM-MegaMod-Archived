#(BURRUINS 1)
     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

THESE RUINS SEEM TO BE REMNANTS OF A CIVILIZATION WHICH CALLED ITSELF THE `BURVIXESE'.

ALL THEIR CITIES HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO RADIOACTIVE SLAG BY SOME FORM OF ENERGY WEAPON SIMILAR TO THE UR-QUAN'S FUSION BLASTER. FROM EVIDENCE WE HAVE GATHERED HERE, WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT THIS ENTIRE CIVILIZATION WAS DESTROYED FROM ORBIT SOMETIME IN THE LAST 8-12 EARTH YEARS.

THERE ARE NO SURVIVORS.

        ---- END OF REPORT ----

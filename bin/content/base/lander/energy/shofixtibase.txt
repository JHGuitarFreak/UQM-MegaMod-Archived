			---- REPORT FROM STARBASE ----

THE NEW GENERATION OF SHOFIXTI HAVE SET UP THIS STARBASE TO PRODUCE SCOUTS FOR OUR FIGHT AGAINST THE UR-QUAN.

THEY'VE SAID THAT WE CAN ONLY HAVE TWO IN OUR FLEET AT A TIME DUE TO LACK OF RESOURCES.

WE CAN COME BACK LATER WHEN WE HAVE SOME SPARE ROOM FOR MORE SCOUTS.

			---- REPORT FROM STARBASE ----

THE NEW GENERATION OF SHOFIXTI HAVE SET UP THIS STARBASE TO PRODUCE SCOUTS FOR OUR FIGHT AGAINST THE UR-QUAN.

UNFORTUNATELY WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH ROOM IN OUR FLEET TO ACCEPT ANY MORE SHIPS AT THIS TIME.

WE SHOULD COME BACK LATER WHEN WE HAVE MORE ROOM IN OUR FLEET.

#(WE_ARE0)	zoqfotpik-000.ogg
Attention starship!
We are the Zoq-Fot-Pik.
#(WE_ARE1)	zoqfotpik-001.ogg
Make no hostile actions!
#(WE_ARE2)	zoqfotpik-002.ogg
We come in peace, and with good will.
#(WE_ARE3)	zoqfotpik-003.ogg
But if you make one false move, you're vapor!
#(WE_ARE4)	zoqfotpik-004.ogg
Don't worry, my companion is just a bit nervous...
#(WE_ARE5)	zoqfotpik-005.ogg
No, I'm not!
#(WE_ARE6)	zoqfotpik-006.ogg
...and argumentative.
#(WE_ARE7)	zoqfotpik-007.ogg
No, I'm not.

#(SCOUT_HELLO0)	zoqfotpik-008.ogg
We are a scout vessel
dispatched from our homeworld.
#(SCOUT_HELLO1)	zoqfotpik-009.ogg
We have travelled far
through hostile, uncharted space
to find you.
We hail from the green dwarf star at coordinates
ziggerfau-gerrrnuf, Ah-ah, Pahoy-hoy.
#(SCOUT_HELLO2)	zoqfotpik-010.ogg
No, you idiot, in their coordinate system!
#(SCOUT_HELLO3)	zoqfotpik-011.ogg
Oh! Er
Coordinates 400.0 : 543.7.

#(INIT_HOME_HELLO0)	zoqfotpik-012.ogg
You have arrived at our homeworld.
#(INIT_HOME_HELLO1)	zoqfotpik-013.ogg
And we've got a billion ships here!
#(INIT_HOME_HELLO2)	zoqfotpik-014.ogg
We are fortunate that you have found us in our time of need.
#(INIT_HOME_HELLO3)	zoqfotpik-015.ogg
So don't even think of trying to attack us!

#(which_fot)
Which one of you creatures is the Fot?

#(HE_IS0)	zoqfotpik-016.ogg
He is.
#(HE_IS1)	zoqfotpik-017.ogg
No, she is!
#(HE_IS2)	zoqfotpik-018.ogg
No, I'm not!
#(HE_IS3)	zoqfotpik-019.ogg
Yes, you are.
#(HE_IS4)	zoqfotpik-020.ogg
Cripes! We've been through this a million times!
#(HE_IS5)	zoqfotpik-021.ogg
That doesn't change anything. You're the Fot!
#(HE_IS6)	zoqfotpik-022.ogg
Faugh!
Well, Captain, as you can see, this is a point of some contention.
#(HE_IS7)	zoqfotpik-023.ogg
Fot!

#(we_are_vindicator)
We are <% comm.getPhrase("name_" .. (state.prop.get("NEW_ALLIANCE_NAME") + 1)) %> flagship <% state.sis.getShipName() %> from Earth. What are your intentions?

#(WE_GLAD0)	zoqfotpik-024.ogg
Hurrah!
Then we've finally found our saviors!
#(WE_GLAD1)	zoqfotpik-025.ogg
Maybe.
#(WE_GLAD2)	zoqfotpik-026.ogg
At last, our search is over!
It is just as the great Crystal ones promised!
#(WE_GLAD3)	zoqfotpik-027.ogg
They look sneaky.
I think they're lying.
#(WE_GLAD4)	zoqfotpik-028.ogg
Quiet, fool!
Can't you see our nightmare is over!?
This ship is from the Great Crystal One's fabled Alliance
the Alliance of Free Stars!
#(WE_GLAD5)	zoqfotpik-029.ogg
Maybe.

#(quiet_toadies)
SILENCE BLATHERING TOADIES! We are your new masters.

#(TOLD_YOU0)	zoqfotpik-030.ogg
We are disappointed.
#(TOLD_YOU1)	zoqfotpik-031.ogg
See! I TOLD you!
#(TOLD_YOU2)	zoqfotpik-032.ogg
We had hoped that our species could be friends.
#(TOLD_YOU3)	zoqfotpik-033.ogg
Never in a million years! Just look at their beady eyes!
#(TOLD_YOU4)	zoqfotpik-034.ogg
But in the spirit of understanding...
#(TOLD_YOU5)	zoqfotpik-035.ogg
Oh, no! You're not even considering...
#(TOLD_YOU6)	zoqfotpik-036.ogg
...We will forgive you this transgression.
#(TOLD_YOU7)	zoqfotpik-037.ogg
Sheesh! What a pushover you are!

#(your_race)
Before we go on, can you tell us more about your species?

#(YEARS_AGO0)	zoqfotpik-038.ogg
In our ancient past, four species evolved intelligence on our homeworld.
#(YEARS_AGO1)	zoqfotpik-039.ogg	
Simultaneously.
#(YEARS_AGO2)	zoqfotpik-040.ogg
They were the Zoq...
#(YEARS_AGO3)	zoqfotpik-041.ogg
...the Fot...
#(YEARS_AGO4)	zoqfotpik-042.ogg
...the Pik...
#(YEARS_AGO5)	zoqfotpik-043.ogg
...and the Zebranky.
#(YEARS_AGO6)	zoqfotpik-044.ogg
We three, the Zoq, Fot, and Pik evolved in such a way
as to acquire sustenance from many sources...
#(YEARS_AGO7)	zoqfotpik-045.ogg
...from airborne zooplankton...
#(YEARS_AGO8)	zoqfotpik-046.ogg
...from solar and ambient energies...
#(YEARS_AGO9)	zoqfotpik-047.ogg
...and from rocky fungal clingers.
#(YEARS_AGO10)	zoqfotpik-048.ogg
Our favorite!
#(YEARS_AGO11)	zoqfotpik-049.ogg
The Zebranky also consumed a variety of foods
namely: the Zoq
the Fot
and the Pik.
#(YEARS_AGO12)	zoqfotpik-050.ogg
To survive the predations of the Zebranky
we banded together
annihilated the Zebranky...
#(YEARS_AGO13)	zoqfotpik-051.ogg
...and formed the cooperative union you now encounter.

#(where_from)
What do you seek from us?

#(TRAVELED_FAR0)	zoqfotpik-052.ogg
We are a relatively peaceful group of species.
#(TRAVELED_FAR1)	zoqfotpik-053.ogg
Unless we're angry.
#(TRAVELED_FAR2)	zoqfotpik-054.ogg
So we find ourselves in need of help.
#(TRAVELED_FAR3)	zoqfotpik-055.ogg
We only need a LITTLE!
#(TRAVELED_FAR4)	zoqfotpik-056.ogg
Because of our desperate situation.
#(TRAVELED_FAR5)	zoqfotpik-057.ogg
`Desperate' is too strong a word.
I think `troublesome' is more like it.

#(what_emergency)
What `nightmare' are you talking about? What's the matter?

#(UNDER_ATTACK0)	zoqfotpik-058.ogg
Our planets are under attack from an invading horde!
#(UNDER_ATTACK1)	zoqfotpik-059.ogg
We do not know who they are, or why they are here.
#(UNDER_ATTACK2)	zoqfotpik-060.ogg
We are being blown to bits.
#(UNDER_ATTACK3)	zoqfotpik-061.ogg
Fleets of alien ships appear out of nowhere
then unleash terrible destructive energies.
#(UNDER_ATTACK4)	zoqfotpik-062.ogg
Fortunately...
#(UNDER_ATTACK5)	zoqfotpik-063.ogg
...they release these energies on each other.
#(UNDER_ATTACK6)	zoqfotpik-064.ogg
Unfortunately...
#(UNDER_ATTACK7)	zoqfotpik-065.ogg
...they favor combat near strong gravity wells.
Their stray shots regularly strike the surface of our planets
often with tragic results.
#(UNDER_ATTACK8)	zoqfotpik-066.ogg
Fortunately...
#(UNDER_ATTACK9)	zoqfotpik-067.ogg
...they have never found our homeworld, only our colony planets.
#(UNDER_ATTACK10)	zoqfotpik-068.ogg
Unfortunately...
#(UNDER_ATTACK11)	zoqfotpik-069.ogg
...all of our colonies have perished as a consequence.

#(tough_luck)
Hey, space is a tough place where wimps eat flaming plasma death.

#(NOT_HELPFUL0)	zoqfotpik-070.ogg
Oh, dear.
#(NOT_HELPFUL1)	zoqfotpik-071.ogg
I told you he looked like a creep!
#(NOT_HELPFUL2)	zoqfotpik-072.ogg
No! We must try to understand.
His ways are not like our own.
#(NOT_HELPFUL3)	zoqfotpik-073.ogg
You mean his WHOLE SPECIES are jerks?
#(NOT_HELPFUL4)	zoqfotpik-074.ogg
Let us give him one more chance.
#(NOT_HELPFUL5)	zoqfotpik-075.ogg
Just look at him! He's a killer, I tell you!

#(what_look_like)
Who is attacking you? What do they look like?

#(LOOK_LIKE0)	zoqfotpik-076.ogg
Some of the vessels are huge, green battleships
which launch wave after wave of small fighters.
#(LOOK_LIKE1)	zoqfotpik-077.ogg
The other ships are black as space
and their hulls are carved with strange alien writing.
#(LOOK_LIKE2)	zoqfotpik-078.ogg
In combat the two ships seem evenly matched.
#(LOOK_LIKE3)	zoqfotpik-079.ogg
One fires blasts of fusion energy
while the other launches spinning projectiles.

#(valuable_info)
You have given us valuable information. Goodbye.

#(GOODBYE0)	zoqfotpik-080.ogg
If you must go now, we understand.
#(GOODBYE1)	zoqfotpik-081.ogg
That's it?! You're leaving?!!
#(GOODBYE2)	zoqfotpik-082.ogg
We hope that on your next visit
we can establish a mutual assistance pact.
#(GOODBYE3)	zoqfotpik-083.ogg
I can't believe that he's just leaving us here!
...what a jerk.

#(all_very_interesting)
Yes, yes, that's all very interesting, but now we are going to attack you!

#(SEE_TOLD_YOU0)	zoqfotpik-084.ogg
What?
#(SEE_TOLD_YOU1)	zoqfotpik-085.ogg
See! I told you.!...
...but would you listen... NO!
#(SEE_TOLD_YOU2)	zoqfotpik-086.ogg
I don't understand!
#(SEE_TOLD_YOU3)	zoqfotpik-087.ogg
So what does all your nicey-nice to the alien get us?
Nothing! That's what!
You should have done what I said
and told him we were the Precursors.

#(how_can_i_help)
We want to help. What can we do?

#(ALLY_WITH_US0)	zoqfotpik-088.ogg
We would like to establish
a formal mutual-assistance pact
with your species.
#(ALLY_WITH_US1)	zoqfotpik-089.ogg
One of those `You scratch my vent
I'll scratch your flipper' set-ups.
#(ALLY_WITH_US2)	zoqfotpik-090.ogg
And as a sign of our good faith
we will provide you with skilled Captains
and plans for building our `Stinger' starships.
#(ALLY_WITH_US3)	zoqfotpik-091.ogg
In return, if the bad guys find our homeworld
you'll rush over here and vaporize 'em.
#(ALLY_WITH_US4)	zoqfotpik-092.ogg
That is, essentially, correct.
#(ALLY_WITH_US5)	zoqfotpik-093.ogg
Great deal, eh?
You can't afford to pass it up!
So what do you say?

#(decide_later)
Uh... I need to consult with our, er... our Grand-High Poobah!

#(PLEASE_HURRY0)	zoqfotpik-094.ogg
Please hurry back with word from your Poobah.
Millions of lives are at stake!
#(PLEASE_HURRY1)	zoqfotpik-095.ogg
Not the least of which is mine.

#(EMMISSARIES0)	zoqfotpik-096.ogg
These are the words we have prayed for!
#(EMMISSARIES1)	zoqfotpik-097.ogg
Hey! This trip's not a waste after all!
#(EMMISSARIES2)	zoqfotpik-098.ogg
More than anything, we seek an ally
to help us survive in this hostile universe.
#(EMMISSARIES3)	zoqfotpik-099.ogg
We are having some problems of that general nature.
#(EMMISSARIES4)	zoqfotpik-100.ogg
But we are only emissaries.
You must meet with our leaders.
They are wiser... more powerful beings!
#(EMMISSARIES5)	zoqfotpik-101.ogg
They look just like us, though.
#(EMMISSARIES6)	zoqfotpik-102.ogg
Fly to the star called Alpha Tucanae.
The planet closest to the sun is our home.
#(EMMISSARIES7)	zoqfotpik-103.ogg
And if possible, hurry.

#(sure)
You are under attack by the Ur-Quan, our enemy as well.  Therefore, speaking for all the People of Earth, I accept your offer.

#(WE_ALLY0)	zoqfotpik-104.ogg
How wonderful!
#(WE_ALLY1)	zoqfotpik-105.ogg
Hurray!
#(WE_ALLY2)	zoqfotpik-106.ogg
How marvelous!
#(WE_ALLY3)	zoqfotpik-107.ogg
Yee-ha!
#(WE_ALLY4)	zoqfotpik-108.ogg
Captain, we shall begin fulfilling our commitment at once!
We will begin transporting our officers to your base immediately!
#(WE_ALLY5)	zoqfotpik-109.ogg
Why, heck!
Maybe I'll even make the trip to your planet!
I'd make a good starship captain, Captain!
I'm pretty darn mean in a fight
and there ain't nobody better than me
with a thrusting stinger tongue attack!

#(never)
What? Protect you failures? No way! You're too lame!

#(WE_ENEMIES0)	zoqfotpik-110.ogg
We have revealed ourselves to you.
We have held out our appendages to you in friendship!...
...and you have treated us like dead Zebrankys.
It takes a great deal to anger one of my species, Captain
BUT YOU HAVE JUST SUCCEEDED!
Attention Shipmates! Man the spray gun! Hoist the tongue!
PREPARE FOR BATTLE!
#(WE_ENEMIES1)	zoqfotpik-111.ogg
Yeah.
Let's toast those creeps!

#(HOSTILE_HELLO_10)	zoqfotpik-112.ogg
Coming here was pointless, human.
Our species are at war.
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_11)	zoqfotpik-113.ogg
Right!
Prepare to die, alien scum!

#(HOSTILE_HELLO_20)	zoqfotpik-114.ogg
If you had allied with us, Captain
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_21)	zoqfotpik-115.ogg
Which you didn't!
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_22)	zoqfotpik-116.ogg
We would gladly tell you what we have learned
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_23)	zoqfotpik-117.ogg
Which we won't!
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_24)	zoqfotpik-118.ogg
Regarding the two warring alien factions
the Ur-Quan and their siblings, the Kohr-Ah.
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_25)	zoqfotpik-119.ogg
But now you'll NEVER know!

#(HOSTILE_HELLO_30)	zoqfotpik-120.ogg
With whatever remaining forces we have
we will do our best to destroy you.
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_31)	zoqfotpik-121.ogg
Yeah! And she means it too!

#(HOSTILE_HELLO_40)	zoqfotpik-122.ogg
Your villainy is beyond possible forgiveness!
We are compelled by our anger to destroy you.
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_41)	zoqfotpik-123.ogg
He's probably just gonna run away again.
The coward!

#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_10)	zoqfotpik-124.ogg
Ah! It is the alien from the Chenjesu's Alliance!
#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_11)	zoqfotpik-125.ogg
Just look at those weapon pods on his ship.
#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_12)	zoqfotpik-126.ogg
We hope that during this visit
we can make clear to your species
the benefits of a mutual-assistance pact.
#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_13)	zoqfotpik-127.ogg
But we're also armed to the teeth
so don't try stealing our atmosphere or anything sneaky like that!

#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_20)	zoqfotpik-128.ogg
Once more, the Alliance starship has returned.
#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_21)	zoqfotpik-129.ogg
Yeah. I bet THIS is the time they try to trick us.
#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_22)	zoqfotpik-130.ogg
Alien Captain, do you bring word from your Leaders?
#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_23)	zoqfotpik-131.ogg
If he does, I bet it's something like
`Submit or be Eaten'!

#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_10)	zoqfotpik-132.ogg
Hello friend and ally!
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_11)	zoqfotpik-133.ogg
Got any presents for us?
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_12)	zoqfotpik-134.ogg
We hope your struggle against the Ur-Quan goes well!
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_13)	zoqfotpik-135.ogg
Darn! He never gives us anything.

#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_20)	zoqfotpik-136.ogg
Welcome back to our world.
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_21)	zoqfotpik-137.ogg
Yeah, welcome back to our world!
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_22)	zoqfotpik-138.ogg
I just said that.
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_23)	zoqfotpik-139.ogg
So? It doesn't mean I can't say it too.
Besides, you always get to talk first.
That's not fair!
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_24)	zoqfotpik-140.ogg
Sorry, that's just the way it is.
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_25)	zoqfotpik-141.ogg
Well why?! That doesn't make sense.
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_26)	zoqfotpik-142.ogg
Look, don't ask me.
I think it's something technical.
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_27)	zoqfotpik-143.ogg
Yeah, right. I'm so sure.
What a lame excuse.

#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_30)	zoqfotpik-144.ogg
Greetings Captain.
What can your allies do for you?
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_31)	zoqfotpik-145.ogg
Your favorite allies!

#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_40)	zoqfotpik-146.ogg
Hello human ally.
We are at your service.
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_41)	zoqfotpik-147.ogg
What do you want?

#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE0)	zoqfotpik-148.ogg
Our Savior! Our Savior!
You have rescued us from certain destruction!
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE1)	zoqfotpik-149.ogg
Howee-baby! That was a close one!
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE2)	zoqfotpik-150.ogg
The black ship appeared in orbit several days ago
and began raining down bolts of destructive energy
on the surface of our planet!
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE3)	zoqfotpik-151.ogg
Fortunately...
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE4)	zoqfotpik-152.ogg
...we were able to focus our planetary shields
to deflect the energy blasts away from our cities.
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE5)	zoqfotpik-153.ogg
Unfortunately...
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE6)	zoqfotpik-154.ogg
Large sections of our planet's beautiful wilderness
have been annihilated... entire ecosystems destroyed.
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE7)	zoqfotpik-155.ogg
Oh! That makes me REALLY mad!
I mean, attacking helpless, intelligent, alien species
that's one thing,
but toasting our cute little wood Jukes and tree Narfs
that is really low!
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE8)	zoqfotpik-156.ogg
If the black ship had been accompanied by others of its kind
we wouldn't have been able stop the rain of destruction.
They would have killed us all.
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE9)	zoqfotpik-157.ogg
Well in that case, better those Jukes and Narfs than us, right?
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE10)	zoqfotpik-158.ogg
Captain, it is clear that in matters of war
you are more capable than ourselves.
With this in mind, we would like to give you
our four finest starships and crew.
I hope they bring you many victories.
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE11)	zoqfotpik-159.ogg
Try not to lose them all right away.

#(bye_homeworld)
Bye Zoq. Bye Fot. Bye Pik.

#(GOODBYE_HOME0)	zoqfotpik-160.ogg
Goodbye Captain.
#(GOODBYE_HOME1)	zoqfotpik-161.ogg
See ya.

#(whats_up_homeworld)
So, what's happening around here?

#(GENERAL_INFO_10)	zoqfotpik-162.ogg
We had a close call last week.
#(GENERAL_INFO_11)	zoqfotpik-163.ogg
One of those black ships was snooping around the system.
#(GENERAL_INFO_12)	zoqfotpik-164.ogg
But before it got to our world
some of the Green ships warped in
destroyed the black vessel
and then left immediately.
#(GENERAL_INFO_13)	zoqfotpik-165.ogg
We got lucky.

#(GENERAL_INFO_20)	zoqfotpik-166.ogg
It's been pretty quiet, Captain.
Nothing new to report.
#(GENERAL_INFO_21)	zoqfotpik-167.ogg
Are you CRAZY?! What about the Frungy Championships!?
#(GENERAL_INFO_22)	zoqfotpik-168.ogg
Why should we tell the Earth Captain about that?
He wouldn't be interested.
#(GENERAL_INFO_23)	zoqfotpik-169.ogg
Oh, yeah? How do you know?
#(GENERAL_INFO_24)	zoqfotpik-170.ogg
Because I'M not even interested.
Nobody with any brains is interested in Frungy!
#(GENERAL_INFO_25)	zoqfotpik-171.ogg
Well what about me, huh?
I LOVE Frungy! It's the Sport of Kings!
#(GENERAL_INFO_26)	zoqfotpik-172.ogg
Sheesh!
#(GENERAL_INFO_27)	zoqfotpik-173.ogg
Oh, all right
he wouldn't know any of the teams anyway.

#(GENERAL_INFO_30)	zoqfotpik-174.ogg
Although this may not pertain to the Ur-Quan
we have received an interesting report
from one of our deep space scouts.
#(GENERAL_INFO_31)	zoqfotpik-175.ogg
She found a strange metal door-thing
embedded in the surface of an alien planet.
#(GENERAL_INFO_32)	zoqfotpik-176.ogg
Although she and her crew spent many days
trying to open the door
#(GENERAL_INFO_33)	zoqfotpik-177.ogg
they failed utterly to so much as budge it.
#(GENERAL_INFO_34)	zoqfotpik-178.ogg
The reported location of this alien artifact
is Epsilon Camelopardalis I-A.
#(GENERAL_INFO_35)	zoqfotpik-179.ogg
Go open it!
I bet there's something cool inside!

#(GENERAL_INFO_40)	zoqfotpik-180.ogg
We may not have told you this before, Captain
but my species is somewhat sensitive
to certain meta-psychic vibrations.
#(GENERAL_INFO_41)	zoqfotpik-181.ogg
Oh, no! Not this mental stuff again!
#(GENERAL_INFO_42)	zoqfotpik-182.ogg
Although my friend's species
has difficulty understanding our powers
I can guarantee you, Captain
that our limited abilities are quite real.
#(GENERAL_INFO_43)	zoqfotpik-183.ogg
Oh, yeah! Remember that time
you said you could fix our broken chronometers
with your `sympathetic psionic waves'?
More like `pathetic waves' if you ask me!
Nyark! Nyark! Nyark!
#(GENERAL_INFO_44)	zoqfotpik-184.ogg
Even through all this negative energy, Captain
we have discovered that...
#(GENERAL_INFO_45)	zoqfotpik-185.ogg
...and THEN there was the time
you said you could bend dorfs with just your...
#(GENERAL_INFO_46)	zoqfotpik-186.ogg
SHUT UP!
#(GENERAL_INFO_47)	zoqfotpik-187.ogg
...sorry.
#(GENERAL_INFO_48)	zoqfotpik-188.ogg
As I was saying, before I was so RUDELY interrupted!...
#(GENERAL_INFO_49)	zoqfotpik-189.ogg
I said I was sorry.
#(GENERAL_INFO_410)	zoqfotpik-190.ogg
Our most talented Seers have detected
some ominous and powerful meta-psychic signals
from the direction of the Orionis constellation.
#(GENERAL_INFO_411)	zoqfotpik-191.ogg
Faker.

#(any_war_news)
Any news about the war between the two alien races?

#(UTWIG_DELAY0)	zoqfotpik-192.ogg
Our scouts have witnessed an exciting event
in the Horologii star system.
#(UTWIG_DELAY1)	zoqfotpik-193.ogg
Yeah! Big news!
#(UTWIG_DELAY2)	zoqfotpik-194.ogg
Two alien races have entered that region of space
from the coreward direction.
#(UTWIG_DELAY3)	zoqfotpik-195.ogg
One of the races look like big talkin' weeds
and the other wears a funny mask.
#(UTWIG_DELAY4)	zoqfotpik-196.ogg
And they are attacking our enemies!
#(UTWIG_DELAY5)	zoqfotpik-197.ogg
Well, ONE of our enemies, anyway.
#(UTWIG_DELAY6)	zoqfotpik-198.ogg
Yes, the new aliens seem to be confining their hostilities
to the sinister Kohr-Ah.
#(UTWIG_DELAY7)	zoqfotpik-199.ogg
Actually, that's good news.
#(UTWIG_DELAY8)	zoqfotpik-200.ogg
By focusing on the Kohr-Ah
who have been winning their war up to this point...
#(UTWIG_DELAY9)	zoqfotpik-201.ogg
They've been plastering the Ur-Quan.
#(UTWIG_DELAY10)	zoqfotpik-202.ogg
The balance of power has been equalized somewhat...
#(UTWIG_DELAY11)	zoqfotpik-203.ogg
But the Kohr-Ah will STILL probably win!
#(UTWIG_DELAY12)	zoqfotpik-204.ogg
But we estimate that the efforts of these new alien races
has delayed the Kohr-Ah's eventual victory
by nine to twelve months.
#(UTWIG_DELAY13)	zoqfotpik-205.ogg
Still, it's better than nothing!

#(KOHRAH_WINNING0)	zoqfotpik-206.ogg
We have modified a few of our Stinger starships
for long-range reconnaissance missions.
#(KOHRAH_WINNING1)	zoqfotpik-207.ogg
We strapped a bunch of fuel tanks on their hulls.
#(KOHRAH_WINNING2)	zoqfotpik-208.ogg
The scouts were ordered to investigate the progress of the war
between the green ships, who we now know as the `Ur-Quan'
and the black ships, flown by the `Kohr-Ah'.
#(KOHRAH_WINNING3)	zoqfotpik-209.ogg
We sent out ten... two came back
#(KOHRAH_WINNING4)	zoqfotpik-210.ogg
But the information they gathered was worth the cost.
#(KOHRAH_WINNING5)	zoqfotpik-211.ogg
Unless you were one of the scouts, I suppose?
Nyark! Nyark! Nyark!
#(KOHRAH_WINNING6)	zoqfotpik-212.ogg
SHUT UP!
#(KOHRAH_WINNING7)	zoqfotpik-213.ogg
...sorry.
#(KOHRAH_WINNING8)	zoqfotpik-214.ogg
Anyway, as I was saying, the intelligence they gathered
indicates that the Kohr-Ah will win their war
sometime near the beginning of the year 2158.
#(KOHRAH_WINNING9)	zoqfotpik-215.ogg
Unless someone evens up the alien forces
by destroying about a bazillion Kohr-Ah ships.

#(URQUAN_NEARLY_GONE0)	zoqfotpik-216.ogg
Our reconnaissance ships have returned once more
#(URQUAN_NEARLY_GONE1)	zoqfotpik-217.ogg
With bad news.
#(URQUAN_NEARLY_GONE2)	zoqfotpik-218.ogg
Based on what they have seen
the Kohr-Ah will defeat the Ur-Quan
in less than six months.
#(URQUAN_NEARLY_GONE3)	zoqfotpik-219.ogg
Bummer.
#(URQUAN_NEARLY_GONE4)	zoqfotpik-220.ogg
And based on our last encounter with the Kohr-Ah
we expect that when they win their war with the Ur-Quan
the Kohr-Ah will move through this entire region of space
destroying all intelligent life.
#(URQUAN_NEARLY_GONE5)	zoqfotpik-221.ogg
Major bummer!

#(KOHRAH_FRENZY0)	zoqfotpik-222.ogg
I fear we have received our last scouting reports, Captain.
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY1)	zoqfotpik-223.ogg
Poor Yip, Tun and Haffy! I'll really miss those guys!
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY2)	zoqfotpik-224.ogg
Although none of our scouts returned home alive
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY3)	zoqfotpik-225.ogg
...and Jiff... and Fod... and (sniff!)...
...and my best pal, Rogi!
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY4)	zoqfotpik-226.ogg
They were able to send a last message.
The Kohr-Ah have won their war against the Ur-Quan
and they have begun their hideous death march.
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY5)	zoqfotpik-227.ogg
(sniff!)
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY6)	zoqfotpik-228.ogg
The only piece of knowledge we have
that may help you defeat them
is a fragment of a transmission we received
from our agent Buppo who was in the Crateris constellation.
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY7)	zoqfotpik-229.ogg
They got Buppo too?!...(SOB!)
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY8)	zoqfotpik-230.ogg
He reported that the Kohr-Ah had something
`big, dangerous and important as hell'
in one of the nearby star systems.
That was all we got before Buppo's signal was cut off.
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY9)	zoqfotpik-231.ogg
(SOB!)
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY10)	zoqfotpik-232.ogg
You have got to stop the Kohr-Ah, Captain!...
...before they kill us all.
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY11)	zoqfotpik-233.ogg
(sniff!)

#(NO_WAR_NEWS0)	zoqfotpik-234.ogg
No. We have nothing new to report.
#(NO_WAR_NEWS1)	zoqfotpik-235.ogg
Nope! Not a thing.

#(i_want_alliance)
I have travelled here to seek an alliance between our peoples.

#(GOOD0)	zoqfotpik-236.ogg
How wonderful! We accept!
#(GOOD1)	zoqfotpik-237.ogg
Hurray!
#(GOOD2)	zoqfotpik-238.ogg
How marvelous!
#(GOOD3)	zoqfotpik-239.ogg
Yee-ha!
#(GOOD4)	zoqfotpik-240.ogg
Captain, we are delighted that your people have made this choice!
#(GOOD5)	zoqfotpik-241.ogg
Now WE won't get slaughtered!
#(GOOD6)	zoqfotpik-242.ogg
In exchange for our cooperation helping you with captains and ship designs
all that we ask for is your protection.
#(GOOD7)	zoqfotpik-243.ogg
So we don't get slaughtered!
#(GOOD8)	zoqfotpik-244.ogg
We shall begin fulfilling our commitment at once!
We will transport officers and our Stinger design to your base immediately!
#(GOOD9)	zoqfotpik-245.ogg
Why, heck!
Maybe I'll even make the trip to your planet!
I'd make a good starship captain, Captain!
I'm pretty darn mean in a fight
and there ain't nobody better than me
with a thrusting stinger tongue attack!

#(want_specific_info)
I would like some specific information.

#(WHAT_SPECIFIC_INFO0)	zoqfotpik-246.ogg
Sure. What do you want to know?
#(WHAT_SPECIFIC_INFO1)	zoqfotpik-247.ogg
Just ask away!

#(enough_info)
That's enough info for now, thanks!

#(OK_ENOUGH_INFO)	zoqfotpik-248.ogg
Anything else?

#(what_about_others)
What do you know about other alien races?

#(ABOUT_OTHERS0)	zoqfotpik-249.ogg
Not much, to tell the truth.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS1)	zoqfotpik-250.ogg
This space exploration stuff is kinda new to us.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS2)	zoqfotpik-251.ogg
Besides the green alien ships...
#(ABOUT_OTHERS3)	zoqfotpik-252.ogg
Which have only tried to kill us.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS4)	zoqfotpik-253.ogg
...and the black alien ships...
#(ABOUT_OTHERS5)	zoqfotpik-254.ogg
Which have actually been QUITE SUCCESSFUL at killing us.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS6)	zoqfotpik-255.ogg
The only other starships we have encountered
are strange tumbling red probes
which profess to be on a peaceful mission...
#(ABOUT_OTHERS7)	zoqfotpik-256.ogg
...but then attack like slavering Zebrankys.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS8)	zoqfotpik-257.ogg
We believe that the probes are actually robotic scouts
which have suffered some kind of malfunction
resulting in their aberrant behavior.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS9)	zoqfotpik-258.ogg
And what's worse, they are multiplying.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS10)	zoqfotpik-259.ogg
Yes, that's true.
The probes seem to be replicating at a geometric rate.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS11)	zoqfotpik-260.ogg
AIEE! That means if there was only one last week
then next month... ah
wait a minute... let me calculate
uh
That means, next month there will be
...A WHOLE MESS OF THOSE THINGS!
#(ABOUT_OTHERS12)	zoqfotpik-261.ogg
By back-tracing the probes' course paths
we have been able to calculate
that the source of the probes
is somewhere on a direct line
that includes our star, and Epsilon Muscae.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS13)	zoqfotpik-262.ogg
Go get 'em, Captain!

#(what_about_zebranky)
Tell me more about your people.

#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY0)	zoqfotpik-263.ogg
Ah! Cultural exchange. A good idea.
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY1)	zoqfotpik-264.ogg
Yeah! Let's tell him about Frungy!
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY2)	zoqfotpik-265.ogg
Be quiet, you fool! He asked a serious question!
He doesn't want to know about Frungy.
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY3)	zoqfotpik-266.ogg
How do you know? What makes you so smart?
You never even asked him if he wants to know about Frungy.
Why, I'll bet right now he's wondering
`What is this wonderful sport, Frungy?', `How is it played?'
`What kind of equipment do you need to play Frungy?'
and `I wonder who's ahead in the Frungy Championships?'
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY4)	zoqfotpik-267.ogg
AUGH! Will you SHUT UP ABOUT FRUNGY?!
If you say another word about that STUPID GAME
I'm going to lose control and blow a cloud of spores at you!
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY5)	zoqfotpik-268.ogg
Yech! Okay, okay. Don't blow your sac.
I won't mention Frungy again, I promise.
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY6)	zoqfotpik-269.ogg
Well, Captain, as you can probably see
our culture's predominant trait
its greatest strength AND weakness
is the diverse interactions between Zoq, Fot, and Pik.
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY7)	zoqfotpik-270.ogg
FRUNGY! FRUNGY! FRUNGY!

#(what_about_past)
What was your history like?

#(ABOUT_PAST0)	zoqfotpik-271.ogg
Our past? Quite a broad topic for this short conversation
but we'll share a key piece of our history with you.
#(ABOUT_PAST1)	zoqfotpik-272.ogg
After we killed off the last Zebranky
we faced an interesting question.
#(ABOUT_PAST2)	zoqfotpik-273.ogg
Should we proceed, and establish a culture
which would advance in art, technology and social sophistication?...
#(ABOUT_PAST3)	zoqfotpik-274.ogg
...Or should we just go back into the forest
and kick back and enjoy ourselves
knowing that a Zebranky wasn't gonna jump out of the bush and eat us!
#(ABOUT_PAST4)	zoqfotpik-275.ogg
Well, we DID go back into the forest.
We stayed there for about five thousand years and had a great time...
#(ABOUT_PAST5)	zoqfotpik-276.ogg
...then, one stormy day, a Zoq, a Fot, and a Pik were walking up a steep path
looking for something good to eat, when a bolt of lightning struck nearby.
With a huge flash of light, the bolt of energy
carved a strangely-shaped chunk of granite out of a cliff.
#(ABOUT_PAST6)	zoqfotpik-277.ogg
It was a disk, with a hole in the middle!
As the rock began to roll down the hill, toward the three terrified beings
some dry grass got caught in its hole, and since the rock was still hot
the grass caught on fire.
#(ABOUT_PAST7)	zoqfotpik-278.ogg
When the rock finally got to the Zoq, the Fot, and the Pik
they simultaneously discovered the Wheel, Fire, and Religion
thus catapulting them on to the road of progress.
#(ABOUT_PAST8)	zoqfotpik-279.ogg
Which has led us to this day, Captain.
Oh! How did the flaming wheel give religion to our Culture, you ask?
#(ABOUT_PAST9)	zoqfotpik-280.ogg
I will explain.
You see, when it got to the threesome, the flaming wheel was going at a pretty good clip
and it ran smack into the Zoq, killing him.
#(ABOUT_PAST10)	zoqfotpik-281.ogg
The Fot and the Pik felt so bad
they really liked that Zoq!...
...that they decided the Zoq hadn't really died when the wheel flattened him
he had just gone to `a better place.'
#(ABOUT_PAST11)	zoqfotpik-282.ogg
Presumably one without lethal flaming wheels.

#(what_about_stinger)
Can you describe your `Stinger' starship?

#(ABOUT_STINGER0)	zoqfotpik-283.ogg
The Stinger is the peak of our technological prowess.
#(ABOUT_STINGER1)	zoqfotpik-284.ogg
It's totally awesome!
#(ABOUT_STINGER2)	zoqfotpik-285.ogg
These vessels are cheap to build
and can be quite effective in short range combat.
#(ABOUT_STINGER3)	zoqfotpik-286.ogg
They turn on a... on a
well a small round thing that's REAL small!
#(ABOUT_STINGER4)	zoqfotpik-287.ogg
Remember though, against most ships
the Stinger must close distance immediately
and give unrelenting tongue attacks
until either the enemy or the Stinger are destroyed.
#(ABOUT_STINGER5)	zoqfotpik-288.ogg
Yeah! The tonguing is the best part!

#(what_about_guy_in_back)
Does that guy in back ever say anything?

#(ABOUT_GUY0)	zoqfotpik-289.ogg
Nope.
#(ABOUT_GUY1)	zoqfotpik-290.ogg
Not a word.

Thank you for playing The Ur-Quan Masters.

#(OUT_TAKES1) zoqfotpik-292.ogg
This game has been brought to you by
Frungy! The Sport of Kings!

#(OUT_TAKES2) zoqfotpik-293.ogg
No it wasn't!

#(OUT_TAKES3) zoqfotpik-293.ogg
Yes it was!

#(OUT_TAKES4) zoqfotpik-294.ogg
Frungy had nothing to do with it!
This game was about war, slavery, intolerance
heroism, justice, and the inevitable triumph of Good over Evil!

#(OUT_TAKES5) zoqfotpik-291.ogg
Are you crazy?! The developers got millions in Frungy endorsements!

#(OUT_TAKES6) zoqfotpik-293.ogg
No they didn't.

#(OUT_TAKES7) zoqfotpik-293.ogg
Yes they did.

#(OUT_TAKES8) zoqfotpik-293.ogg
No they didn't!

#(OUT_TAKES9) zoqfotpik-293.ogg
Yes they did!

#(OUT_TAKES10) zoqfotpik-293.ogg
Did not!

#(OUT_TAKES11) zoqfotpik-293.ogg

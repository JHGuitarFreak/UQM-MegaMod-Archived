#(who_you)
Who are you? What can you tell us about yourselves?

#(WE_ARE_ORZ)	orz-001.ogg
Who are you? You are not Orz! We are Orz! Orz are happy $*people energy*$ from the outside.
Inside is good. So much good that Orz will always $*germinate*$.
Can you come together with Orz for $*parties*$?

#(why_here)
Okay, right. Uh... maybe you could tell me why you are here.

#(HERE_BECAUSE)	orz-002.ogg
Here is $*bright*$ and $*smooth*$. The other place is $*hurt*$ Orz too much tired for keeping together.
Other place is $*Frumple*$. Orz are here now, but almost not yet.
Soon Orz are really here! You are help Orz with $*parties*$.
Orz looking for you, and find you. So much joy!!
Now $*smooth*$ place all the time, and after now never going back to outside.
Never!!

#(ALLIED_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_1)	orz-003.ogg
Hello to our $*house*$. Do you feel $*better*$ yet?
If you are $*campers*$ you will enjoy $*the change*$, but maybe not yet.
It is best if many happy Orz are coming to your $*house*$.
Let's $*spitting*$ the fun words for several $*pieces*$ and then surprising things!!!

#(ALLIED_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_2)	orz-004.ogg
This is my $*house*$. Do you want to know a $*secret*$? Do not $*think*$ it is $*not campers*$.
You are so many $*lonely*$ $*juicy*$ $*bubbles*$. It is so sad.
Now that you are $*campers*$ you will have more $*parties*$...
...and no more $*sad*$ $*lonely*$ $*bubbles*$.
This is the $*secret*$.

#(ALLIED_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_3)	orz-005.ogg
Happy to come to my $*house*$ some more times. I am Orz.
I do not have the name because I am Orz. Orz is the name.
Do you want to $*squirt*$?
If you want to, then you do. It is best, I know it.

#(ALLIED_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_4)	orz-006.ogg
Happy to come to my $*house*$ some more times. I am Orz.
I do not have the name because I am Orz. Orz is the name.
Do you want to $*squirt*$?
If you want to, then you do. It is best, I know it.

#(ALLIED_SPACE_HELLO_1)	orz-007.ogg
Oh, the $*alliance*$ $*party*$ $*campers*$ are in the $*now space*$.
It is $*happy spices*$. Why are you there?
Of course because also the Orz are in the $*now space*$.
So I am waiting for you to $*spit*$. It is a pleasure.

#(ALLIED_SPACE_HELLO_2)	orz-008.ogg
$*Campers*$ like to say `hello' when they $*smell*$ the Orz.
We have learned this. It is $*no function*$ but Orz want to make $*campers*$ happy everyday.
Okay... Hello!! Now you are happy I am sure.

#(ALLIED_SPACE_HELLO_3)	orz-009.ogg
I am $*expanding*$! It is so much $*squishy*$ to $*smell*$ you!
$*Campers*$ are the best! I have $*anticipation*$ and then what?
Better parties in $*the middle*$ for sure.

#(ALLIED_SPACE_HELLO_4)	orz-010.ogg
I am $*expanding*$! It is so much $*squishy*$ to $*smell*$ you!
$*Campers*$ are the best! I have $*anticipation*$ and then what?
Better parties in $*the middle*$ for sure.

#(whats_up_ally)
Uh.....Hi there. Its good to see you again....I think.

#(GENERAL_INFO_ALLY_1)	orz-011.ogg
That is $*funny*$. You think you $*see*$ Orz but Orz are not $*light reflections*$.
Maybe you think Orz are $*many bubbles*$ too. It is such a joke.
Orz are not $*many bubbles*$ like $*campers*$. Orz are just Orz.
I am Orz. I am one with many $*fingers*$.
My $*fingers*$ reach through into $*heavy space*$ and you $*see*$ $*Orz bubbles*$
but it is really $*fingers*$.
Maybe you do not even $*smell*$? That is sad.
$*Smelling*$ $*pretty colors*$ is the best $*game*$.

#(GENERAL_INFO_ALLY_2)	orz-012.ogg
Perhaps you have not been to the $*Playground*$.
The $*Playground*$ is for Taalo and for Orz, but $*Campers*$ can go.
It more fun than several.
The $*Playground*$ is 372.1, 261.9 your $*silly*$ numbers.
You can go there for too much fun.

#(GENERAL_INFO_ALLY_3)	orz-013.ogg
Hello! I will say again for extra enjoyment. So much a fun game.
Hello! Hello! Next I will $*spit*$ $*slow time*$ words to you for better $*dancing*$.
Do you know? Orz can $*dance*$ very well.
Now you are a $*happy camper*$ and Orz can give $*heavy space*$ ships for $*dancing*$.
Orz will give. Orz ships have the GO! GO!. Do you know?
These are best for letting go near $*heavy space*$ planet bodies.
Then GO! GO! can going fastest to enter ships of the $*other*$.
Then it is $*happy time*$.

#(GENERAL_INFO_ALLY_4)	orz-014.ogg
Even more $*pleasant combinations*$. I am $*successful*$ the most.
Perhaps after the biggest $*party*$ you will understanding the Orz
and I can showing you other $*levels*$.
There are so many, but you only $*play*$ on this one.
One is not enough.
We are $*friends*$ now. Never be afraid to $*open*$ enough and $*spread the wax*$.

#(more_about_you)
I'm afraid I'm still not exactly clear on who you are and where you're from.

#(ABOUT_US_1)	orz-015.ogg
You are a $*silly*$ $*camper*$. I am always Orz.
If I was not Orz, then I would not be, but of course I am Orz.
We are from the $*outside*$. Also the Arilou $*quick babies*$ are from $*outside*$.
It is the same, but not.
Orz are from $*below*$, Arilou are from $*above*$.
Orz does not like Arilou. Arilou are too much trouble.
We can not have $*parties*$ when Arilou always $*jumping in front*$.
It makes Orz $*frumple*$ so much.
These are $*fat*$ words. Do you want to play this some more?

#(ABOUT_US_2)	orz-016.ogg
I will tell again the many $*pieces*$. You do not know $*special things*$.
Here is some. $*Time*$ is not one but many.
$*Space*$ is many. $*Colors*$ are many. You are so $*sticky*$.
You cannot $*slide*$ like Orz from $*outside*$ to $*inside*$ and $*in between*$.
It is sad, but Orz can $*pull*$ the $*campers*$ after being $*connected*$.
This is soon.
Orz are trying to $*pull*$ the Androsynth, but they are so $*silly*$, they do not want.
Arilou can $*slide*$. Also Taalo. Many can $*slide*$, but Orz are better of course.

#(ABOUT_US_3)	orz-017.ogg
Here is $*good news*$!
Six or nine $*pieces*$ ago, myself the Orz did not even $*smell*$ your $*level*$.
Can you believe? It is so silly! It is such a $*happy town*$.
Then the Androsynth made some $*slippery places*$ and then Orz can $*smell*$ it.
It $*smells*$ so good Orz are surprised!
I, myself pushed the $*fingers*$ into the $*new town*$ and there are so many $*campers*$.
First the VUX, but they are such $*silly cows*$
they ask so much about the Androsynth we must $*dance*$ with them.
Then we can $*smell*$ the Arilou. Again they are $*jumping in front*$.
It is always! Nnnnggaaahhhhh!
There is $*juice squeezing*$ and then we are not so $*frumple*$.
Finally we find you, the $*happy campers*$ and the Taalo $*playground*$ for sliding through.
Where are the Taalo? There they are. It is too much fun.
We are too happy, in this $*slow time*$ $*heavy space*$. It is a better $*level*$ for games.
This is the everything story. Now you know.

#(ABOUT_US_4)	orz-018.ogg
I am already telling the everything story. It is too much.
You do not asking about us the many.
Next it is the $*party*$ and you will $*become*$.
It is best.
After this you are so $*happy*$ you do not ask the many questions.
Do you anticipate? Yes! You do!
I am too $*tired*$ the $*silly*$ word $*game*$.

#(where_androsyn)
Our charts show this as Androsynth space. Do you know what happened to them?

#(DISEMBLE_ABOUT_ANDROSYN)	orz-019.ogg
Androsynth are not here. Orz are here.
You are not the same too much like Androsynth. You are $*happy campers*$.
Do you want to see our surprising $*toys*$? No!! Do Not!!
Androsynth are so silly. We do not $*tell stories*$ a lot about them.
No more Androsynth $*stories*$.

#(must_know_about_androsyn)
What happened?? Dammit, what did you do to the Androsynth?!!

#(KNOW_TOO_MUCH)	orz-020.ogg
Nnnnnngaaaa!!!! I am $*squeezing*$ the $*juice*$.
You have become too close. You are $*sick*$ for the last time!
Nnnnnnggggaaaaaa!! It is not enough for $*happy days*$ I am sure.
More and more $*juice*$!
Androsynth are not the story!!

#(dont_really_care)
Uh, that's okay. I didn't really care about them so much anyway.

#(YOU_ARE_OUR_FRIENDS)	orz-021.ogg
Ahaa! I am told other Orz $*cousins*$ you are $*connected*$ for $*camping*$.
I am so right!
It is happiest days to not care about Androsynth anything.
So now we can be $*together*$ for friendly $*dessert*$.
I am so right. I will tell them again.

#(about_andro_1)
Now please don't take this the wrong way, but what did happen to the Androsynth?

#(FORGET_ANDRO_1)	orz-022.ogg
I am say best word $*frumple*$. Maybe you do not know.
$*Frumple*$ be $*round*$ yet $*lumpy*$. So bad!!!
The asking about Androsynth is so $*frumple*$ we are not happy.
Do not asking it so much.
It is better to not $*frumple*$ or else there is so much problems.
No more Androsynth is better.

#(about_andro_2)
Just tell me this. Are we in for the same fate as them?

#(FORGET_ANDRO_2)	orz-023.ogg
You are not same. You are $*happy campers*$, but already you know.
I will not talking about $*silly*$ Androsynth, now is stop asking.
If you are say the question another time
it is $*frumple*$ too much and Orz are $*dancing*$ for $*dissolving*$ the $*campers*$.
I am clear!!
You are not so $*silly*$!

#(about_andro_3)
Okay, okay. Now this isn't really a question, but let's say you WERE going to talk about the Androsynth. If you were, what would you say?

#(BLEW_IT)	orz-024.ogg
Nnnnnggggaaaahhhhh!!!!!! It is $*dancing*$!!!!

#(NEUTRAL_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_1)	orz-025.ogg
This is my $*house*$. Did you come to $*play*$?.
Do not be sad if you are $*other*$. We can still have a $*party*$.
There are never enough $*campers*$.

#(NEUTRAL_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_2)	orz-026.ogg
You want to $*take*$ $*silly*$ words in $*slow time*$. It is okay.
I will $*spit*$ words and then perhaps it is the $*party*$.
Welcome to my $*house*$ or $*other house*$.
It is a joke! Only it is my $*house*$.

#(NEUTRAL_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_3)	orz-027.ogg
Again you have come to my $*house*$. It is the same time.
Why are you coming? Do you always the $*slow time*$?
I am surprised!
Oh well. Now is for $*fun time*$, not worrying.

#(NEUTRAL_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_4)	orz-028.ogg
Again you have come to my $*house*$. It is the same time.
Why are you coming? Do you always the $*slow time*$?
I am surprised!
Oh well. Now is for $*fun time*$, not worrying.

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_1)	orz-029.ogg
Hello extremely! I hope you like to $*play*$.
Some $*campers*$ are not so good for $*games*$.
Is it time for $*playing*$ yet?

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_2)	orz-030.ogg
Pleasant $*combinations*$! We have been $*anticipating*$ about you.
Do you like $*parties*$? We do several times, and so much the better.

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_3)	orz-031.ogg
So much $*juicy*$! Let's have $*party time*$ sooner.

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_4)	orz-032.ogg
Hi. You seem like good $*campers*$.
Perhaps we can do $*snappy fun*$ with you everytime.

#(hostile_1)
Do not attempt any hostilities or you will be immediately destroyed.

#(HOSTILITY_IS_BAD_1)	orz-033.ogg
If you are $*sick*$ you should have a $*party*$.
We can come and $*play*$ at your $*house*$.

#(hostile_2)
We have no time for childish nonsense. We require information. Comply at once.

#(HOSTILITY_IS_BAD_2)	orz-034.ogg
$*Extra sick fish*$ need $*special training*$ for extra $*fun*$.
We will have a $*happy party*$ now.

#(we_are_vindicator)
Greetings. I am Captain <% state.sis.getCaptainName() %>, of the starship <% state.sis.getShipName() %>. We are having some difficulty translating your messages.

#(NICE_TO_MEET_YOU)	orz-035.ogg
Yes, of course. Difficulty. Problems are difficult.
Let's be $*special*$ together. $*Spicy games*$ are always fun.

#(seem_like_nice_guys)
You seem like friendly fellows. Perhaps you could aid us in our mission?

#(ARE_NICE_WANT_ALLY)	orz-036.ogg
Yes. Yes. We are too friendly.
Extremely happy $*sisters*$ should correct each other for $*celebration*$.
So much enjoyment!
Shall we come to your $*house*$ so that we can be $*relatives*$?

#(talk_about_alliance)
We have reconsidered the idea of an alliance between our peoples.

#(OK_TALK_ALLIANCE)	orz-037.ogg
So much the better! Orz have been waiting for $*alliance*$ time.
I will show you the $*inside*$.
It is so good that you will never leave.
Oh, I am so excited for expecting $*alliance parties*$.
Yes! Yes! Reconsider is best.

#(yes_alliance)
Uh....I presume you are talking about an alliance. Yes, we are very interested.

#(GREAT)	orz-038.ogg
Jumping $*peppers*$!! This is smiley time!
You are $*campers*$ after all!!
We will start $*alliance*$ $*parties*$ for better enjoyment!

#(no_alliance)
I am not quite sure, but I think the answer is no.

#(MAYBE_LATER)	orz-039.ogg
Disappointing $*conclusions*$.
Maybe we can play $*alliance*$ another happy day.
I will tell $*Orz puppies*$ to wait for $*camping*$.

#(decide_later)
No point in rushing into anything. Let us think about it some more.

#(OK_LATER)	orz-040.ogg
Yes! Think and then do! You will tell us soon. Soon is now.
$*Parties*$ can be so much fun for other reasons.
$*Alliance*$ is good.

#(why_so_trusting)
You seem very... uh, trusting. Why is that?

#(TRUSTING_BECAUSE)	orz-041.ogg
We are not trusting. We like to be $*together*$.
Do you want to be $*together*$ with us?
Always the other $*sad animals*$ go away, but first we have lots of fun.
Too many fun is not enough!! Do you agree?
I think you $*smell*$ like you do.
This is the story about trusting.
It is sad and makes many Orz $*dissolve*$ or burst into several.
Why is it that you are trusting? What a funny question.
I am tired.

#(bye_neutral)
Well, it's been.... uh... well, I'm afraid I have to go now. Do you understand?

#(GOODBYE_NEUTRAL)	orz-042.ogg
Going. Yes. Orz is go with you same place for $*party*$.
Nobody is forget.
Next is $*alliance*$ $*party*$. Always promise is good to keep.
So much pleasure is coming, Orz and the you is change together as soon as $*camping*$ is started.
You are not even aware, and then everyone is so happy.
You are not forget. Alliance is promise.
Orz are wait.

#(ANGRY_SPACE_HELLO_1)	orz-043.ogg
Orz are find you! You do not $*play*$ with Orz so it is not even $*happy town*$.
Orz are think that $*dissolving*$ is a better chance for you.
This is a good plan. Orz are accomplishing this for better $*games*$.
Now is time for $*dissolving*$.

#(ANGRY_SPACE_HELLO_2)	orz-044.ogg
So many times Orz are say 'Hello, we are Orz', but next is always same.
Certainly you are $*silly cows*$.
Now is try again for $*dissolving*$. Of course this is best for extra fun.
After dissolved, $*silly cows*$ will not be $*frumple*$
and Orz will have $*special sauce*$, not the $*juice*$.

#(ANGRY_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_1)	orz-045.ogg
You have come to our $*house*$ but we cannot $*play*$ the fun $*games*$ with you.
Nnnnngggaaahhh!!
You are not even $*campers*$. Why are you coming to our $*house*$?
We cannot $*smell*$ you even a little.
So much trouble in $*slow time*$ is not the best.

#(ANGRY_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_2)	orz-046.ogg
You are not $*connected*$! Too many times I speak the $*silly*$ words in $*slow time*$.
No more speaking.
Next you must $*dissolve*$ and $*become*$ the second time.
Orz will help you $*dissolving*$.

#(whats_up_angry)
You appear to be upset. Have I offended you somehow?

#(GENERAL_INFO_ANGRY_1)	orz-047.ogg
Orz is upset! Not one the many!
We are $*squeezing*$ the $*juice*$!
You are showing that you are not $*happy campers*$
and so Orz cannot have the $*party*$.
Orz need $*party*$ or there is no fun and we are $*frumple*$ everyday.
This is so sad, Orz is upset of course.

#(GENERAL_INFO_ANGRY_2)	orz-048.ogg
Too many times explaining the silly words.
How many time? One? Two? Three? Seven?
Orz are ready to find new $*friends*$. You do not want to $*play*$.
Do not coming to our $*house*$.

#(were_sorry)
I'm not sure what I said wrong, but in any event, I'm sorry.

#(APOLOGY_ACCEPTED)	orz-049.ogg
$*Sorry*$ is good fun. Yes, we are see it is the $*game*$.
You are strangest $*campers*$, but Orz is understand now.
We will come to your $*house*$ and we will be $*sorry*$ too.
Then is $*partytime*$.
Oh, the funny $*joke*$ is $*sorry*$. There are no more $*silly cows*$.
This is $*happy town*$ after all!

#(insult_1)
You are a dangerous species. We want nothing to do with you.

#(insult_2)
If anyone is going to do any `dissolving' around here it's going to be you!

#(insult_3)
That's it! I've had it! You're dead.

#(insult_4)
That's it! I've had it! You're dead.

#(insult_5)
That's it! I've had it! You're dead.

#(insult_6)
That's it! I've had it! You're dead.

#(insult_7)
That's it! I've had it! You're dead.

#(insult_8)
That's it! I've had it! You're dead.

#(INSULTED_1)	orz-050.ogg
$*Dangerous*$ is not the way! Orz are happy $*fun*$ days all the time.
$*Silly cow*$ is so strange Orz think.
Next $*silly cow*$ are $*dissolving*$ and no more word making in $*slow time*$.
Then $*happy days*$ are here again.

#(INSULTED_2)	orz-051.ogg
Orz are not $*dissolve*$! Why is the $*silly cow*$ say Orz are $*dissolving*$?
Too much crazy perhaps. You are so sick even for a $*party*$.
Again I am $*squeezing the juice*$. Nnnggaaaahhh!!
It does not even helping.

#(INSULTED_3)	orz-052.ogg
We are not $*dead*$. Orz is never $*dead*$.
Orz is thinking $*silly cow*$ are want to $*dance*$.
Orz can $*dance*$ very well $*in between*$...
...but not as much fun as $*parties*$.

#(INSULTED_4)	orz-053.ogg
We are not $*dead*$. Orz is never $*dead*$.
Orz is thinking $*silly cow*$ are want to $*dance*$.
Orz can $*dance*$ very well $*in between*$
but not as much fun as $*parties*$.

#(bye_angry)
You are just too darn strange. I'm out of here.

#(GOODBYE_ANGRY)	orz-054.ogg
Orz cannot be $*strange*$. Orz is Orz. Strange is other thing.
You are the $*silliest cow*$ even more so.
At least you can $*dance*$ with Orz.
After the $*dancing*$ Orz think you will make good $*special sauce*$.
Maybe even for other Orz $*party*$, so do not be sad.

#(ANGRY_TAALO_HELLO_1)	orz-055.ogg
Who is it? It is the $*not Campers*$.
Maybe you have come to Taalo $*playground*$ for a $*Picnic*$.
No!!! It is not the case! $*Silly Cows*$ can never have a $*picnic*$.
Of course. Not even a party.
If you are gone, Orz can have fun some more.

#(ANGRY_TAALO_HELLO_2)	orz-056.ogg
I am not expecting, and then what? Again the $*Silly Cows*$.
You think that the $*Playground*$ is a $*fun*$ place?
I will explain. It is not.
Now it is explained. Of course you understand.
It is enough talking the words. You are leaving.

#(FRIENDLY_ALLIED_TAALO_HELLO_1)	orz-057.ogg
Happy $*pieces*$! I am $*squirting nice colors*$!
Why? The reason.
$*Camper friends*$ have come to Taalo $*Playground*$.
Why are you coming to this?

#(FRIENDLY_ALLIED_TAALO_HELLO_2)	orz-058.ogg
I $*smell*$ you so much. $*Campers*$ are pleasant.
You are coming again to the $*Playground*$.
We can have extra fun for future $*parties*$ in $*quick time*$.

#(demand_to_land)
I demand that you allow us to pass so that we can land on the surface.

#(NO_DEMAND)	orz-059.ogg
NNNNgggggaaahhhhh!!!!!! You are $*frumple*$! You are silly!!
Is this happy? NO!!! I cannot $*spit*$ words with $*Cows*$!
There is no demanding!
We will $*dance*$ now for several $*pieces*$.

#(ASK_NICELY)	orz-060.ogg
You are not $*spitting*$ happy words. Demand is not happy.
If you want to going onto $*Playground*$ then $*happy words*$ are best.
Do you understand the most?
It is so simple.

#(why_you_here)
Why are you here at this planet?

#(ANGRY_EXPLANATION)	orz-061.ogg
This answer is not for $*Silly Cows*$.
You do not know Taalo. Taalo are not the $*friends*$.
You are coming to the $*Playground*$ and then making words.
Always you make Orz $*squeezing*$ the $*juice*$. We do not have enough.
I do not want to $*smell*$ you now.

#(FRIENDLY_EXPLANATION)	orz-062.ogg
I will tell. This is Taalo $*Playground*$. Do you know?
Taalo is not anymore the $*heavy space*$. They are not here.
To $*play*$ with Taalo, Orz must $*spread*$ into $*Pretty Space*$.
There are so many good places for this here, Orz are happy.
Of course you do not know Taalo. You are $*Campers*$.
You cannot going to $*Pretty Space*$, too bad.

#(what_is_this_place)
What do you mean by `Playground'? Can you explain some more?

#(FRIENDLY_PLACE)	orz-063.ogg
Yes. Yes. You say words, then I say.
It is fun $*in between*$. More fun than $*dancing*$.
Many $*gravity centers*$ in $*heavy space*$ make good $*party places*$.
This is why we like the $*New Town*$. So many $*Campers*$ and then what?
Even the $*Playgrounds*$! Such a surprise!
At this $*Playground*$, Taalo are making $*Time jokes*$. It is too funny for the Orz.
Taalo are in $*heavy space*$ and next what?
They spread to $*Pretty Space*$ because Dnyarri are chasing them.
Now Dnyarri are sleeping, so Orz can $*chase*$ them.
Then we can have a $*party*$. They are even better $*campers*$ than you.
Do not feeling bad. You are good enough $*campers*$, but not yet.

#(ANGRY_PLACE)	orz-064.ogg
Why explaining? You are not a $*camper*$! You are too $*hard*$!
If you want $*words with fluid*$ then you must be $*campers*$!
Of course you are so silly. That is too much. Do not asking about $*playgrounds*$.
If you want to be a $*camper*$ you can go to my $*house*$.
Silly name is Gamma Vulpeculae.

#(may_we_land)
Would you mind if we did a bit of exploring on the planet's surface?

#(SURE_LAND)	orz-065.ogg
You are ask if Orz are upset? Orz are not upset.
You are $*happy campers*$. Certainly you are only $*slow time*$ $*walkers*$.
It is not fun on the surface in $*slow time*$.
If you want to go, that is okay.

#(ALLIES_CAN_VISIT)	orz-066.ogg
Only $*campers*$ can go to the $*playground*$.
$*Alliance parties*$ are often a good idea for better $*parties*$.
Even for $*picnics*$.
Do you want to be $*campers*$ for the $*friendly days*$?

#(make_alliance)
All right, all right. We'll be `campers'. How do we do that?

#(CANT_ALLY_HERE)	orz-067.ogg
$*Jumping Peppers!*$ I am $*squirting*$ more $*nice colors*$.
It is the best way!
You will be very happy $*campers*$. Do not be $*terrified*$.
It is better as $*campers*$.
You must going to my $*house*$ to start $*camping*$.
It is 371.3, 253.7 location.
We are so busy here for starting the $*campers*$!

#(why_busy)
What are you busy doing?

#(BUSY_BECAUSE)	orz-068.ogg
Busy is because Orz have reason. It is secret for $*campers*$.
You must going quickly to my $*house*$.
It is too bad you cannot $*HYUIVBHJHG*$ there
but flying the $*heavy*$ ship is okay.
Perhaps next we will show you our toys. But do not look!!!
Now you will go to my $*house*$.

#(bye_taalo)
Well, it's been swell, but I really should be going now.

#(bye_ally)
I could stay and talk all day, but I'm afraid I must go. Farewell, allies!

#(GOODBYE_ALLY)	orz-069.ogg
Yes! We do! Goodbye is the $*Game*$. Hello!! I am only joke.
It is funny enough. Do not forget to $*enjoy the sauce*$!!!

#(FRIENDLY_TAALO_GOODBYE)	orz-070.ogg
I am so sad myself. You are not here and then I do not think of $*parties*$.
Oh well. It is so much excitement for the next time.
You must leave now so then you must come back.
Yes. I understand very well.

#(ANGRY_TAALO_GOODBYE)	orz-071.ogg
Finally you are $*absorbing*$. I am tired of $*spitting*$ the meaning.
Go. It is $*happy days*$ after you are gone.
Then I will have enough $*juice*$.
So much the better.

#(HOSTILE_HELLO_1)	orz-072.ogg
Nnnnnngaaaa!!!! I am $*squeezing*$ the $*juice*$.
More and more $*juice*$!
You are $*sick*$ for the last time!

#(HOSTILE_HELLO_2)	orz-073.ogg
Nnnnnggggaaaahhhhh!!!!!! It is $*dancing*$!!!!

#(OUT_TAKES) orz-074.ogg
$*Happy campers*$ are the best. It is $*happy*$
HOLD IT! I'm getting sick of this stupid dialog!
Who wrote this stuff -- a five year old?
Okay, okay. I'll try it again $*sigh*$...
...$*Happy*$ campers are best. It is good to $*smell*$ you again...

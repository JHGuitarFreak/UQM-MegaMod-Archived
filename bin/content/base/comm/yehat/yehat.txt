#(HOMEWORLD_HELLO_1)	yehat-000.ogg
It is sure and a true thing that the alien interloper has now been warned
not to approach Caer Zeep-Reep, the Queen's High Perch
lest it be blasted without further warning!

#(HOMEWORLD_HELLO_2)	yehat-001.ogg
It is a shocking thing to see the return of the human renegade!
One knows this will not be boding well with her Majesty today.

#(whats_up_homeworld)
What has happened in the twenty years since our species last met?

#(GENERAL_INFO_HOMEWORLD_1)	yehat-002.ogg
It is a wondering thought that crosses my mind human starship Captain.
Are ye not knowing that the cause of our Queen and empire
is now allied with the fortunes of the mighty Ur-Quan?...
...and that yer presence here is being only the end of yer life?
Haven't ye got the sense, human, to know this simple thing?

#(GENERAL_INFO_HOMEWORLD_2)	yehat-003.ogg
Ye are asking the words of a mindless child, human!
Here, in the Hall of the Queen's High Perch
ye shall not be finding the sympathies ye so vainly seek.
There are none here but the nobles and battlemasters of the Yehat Clans.
It is a sure thing that we will not be casting flower petals in yer path of rebellion.

#(i_demand_you_ally_homeworld)
I, <% state.sis.getCaptainName() %>, of <% comm.getPhrase("name_" .. (state.prop.get("NEW_ALLIANCE_NAME") + 1)) %>, commanding the <% state.sis.getShipName() %>, demand that you uphold your duties as allies of the human species!

#(ENEMY_MUST_DIE)	yehat-004.ogg
Are ye DAFT human!? Have ye not heard our words?
You and yer kind are slaves, just as we
but you humans have been confined within a shield of slaves!
To be found outside this selfsame shield is surely yer own doom!
It is NOT a permitted thing fer ye to be a-travelling through space
and now, we must be conforming to our Queen's oath to the Ur-Quan.
We must be getting about the business of killing you!

#(at_least_help_us_homeworld)
You must help us. Surely you owe us this much, at least!

#(NO_HELP_ENEMY)	yehat-005.ogg
It is an unbelievable thing!
Ye speak the words that ruffle our feathers and cause our blood to boil!
We, the loyal servants of our Queen, bless her Beak, will not be helping the likes of you
or any of the traitor Yehat bastards ye may have found among the ranks of the starship Clans!

#(give_info)
Surely giving us some scraps of information would be okay, wouldn't it?

#(NO_INFO_FOR_ENEMY)	yehat-006.ogg
Our Queen has spoken the commands to us, and we are obeying her words!
No assistance, of any kind at all, shall be given to you, human
so do not be making the assumptions, that ye know a right thing from a wrong!
Are ye smarter than the Queen, is that what yer saying, human?
We shall not be giving ye a SCRAP OF MEAT!... much less our secrets.

#(what_about_pkunk_royalist)
We have encountered an offshoot of your species, the Pkunk. Tell us about them.

#(PKUNK_ABSORBED_ROYALIST)	yehat-007.ogg
The Pkunk have been absorbed.
They are no more. This is how it should be.
Now the matter is settled, human. Do not be bringing it up again...

#(HATE_PKUNK_ROYALIST)	yehat-008.ogg
The cowards live?!! This is unbelievable!!
It is a SAD, SAD day to be hearing this thing from ye, human.
The P... the Pku... I canna even say their vile name!
The Pku... PKU-NK! are the greatest embarrassment our species has ever suffered!
Do not be calling these wretched creatures an offshoot of our species!
Better it is that ye be calling them GARBAGE or DROPPINGS!
Or better yet do not be talking about them at all!

#(bye_homeworld)
You disappoint us. We expected more from you. Goodbye.

#(GOODBYE_AND_DIE_HOMEWORLD)	yehat-009.ogg
So human, now ye be thinking that ye shall slink away
to commit some vile treason and dirty our Queen's good name. Isn't this true?
Do not be answering! We know the truth.
We will not let ye pass!

#(SPACE_HELLO_1)	yehat-010.ogg
What am I seeing on my view screen!?
It is none other than the flattened old face of our friends the human!
But old ally, are ye not knowing that we, the Yehat are allied with the Ur-Quan now?...
and yer presence outside the slave shield, and in an armed starship
are clear violations of yer Oath of Fealty?!
Whatever shall we do? It just isn't a right thing to kill you, human,
but as a loyal member of my Clan, I must obey the wishes of our Queen!

#(SPACE_HELLO_2)	yehat-011.ogg
Human, what are you doing back here!? Are you totally off yer perch!?
We have sympathies fer yer cause, tis true
but we must obey the orders of our Queen, however much we may disagree with them!

#(SPACE_HELLO_3)	yehat-012.ogg
Human! I am beginning to think that ye are touched, fer sure!
Ye tempt fate and our sympathy too much, I think.
This time, perhaps we cannot be as much yer friends as ye would like.

#(SPACE_HELLO_4)	yehat-013.ogg
Human! Human. You try our souls with yer return!
What is it ye be wanting now?

#(whats_up_space_1)
We should be allies... friends! Explain why this cannot be.

#(GENERAL_INFO_SPACE_1)	yehat-014.ogg
Your words are flying in the face of the facts, human.
We are no longer being your allies.
But unlike the nobles of our homeworld, we, of the Starship Clans
are bereaved at this course of events.
The Queen's decision to be joining the Hierarchy, pains us!

#(whats_up_space_2)
How did the Ur-Quan defeat you? What happened?

#(GENERAL_INFO_SPACE_2)	yehat-015.ogg
WE - WERE - NOT - DEFEATED, HUMAN!!!!
Never! Never in the two-thousand years of the Veep-Neep Queens
have the Yehat ever, EVER suffered a defeat!
It is this fact ALONE that is making our loyalty to the Queen so strong!
This is the unbreakable bond that keeps the Clans together!
When the Ur-Quan were entering our home star system at Gamma Serpentis
we had a thousand starships prepared to defend our home
and then... the Queen... She... she
allied with the Ur-Quan
and the fight is over before it is even begun. AWK!

#(whats_up_space_3)
What about your legendary honor? Your courage? What would the Shofixti think?!

#(GENERAL_INFO_SPACE_3)	yehat-016.ogg
(sob!)... (whimper) We have fallen so far. (sob!)
We are not being the same (whimper!) great birds of prey your people were once knowing and trusting.
We have each betrayed the honor of our Clan, (whimper!)... just as our Queen
is betraying each of us with her association with the Ur-Quan...
If the valiant child species, the (sob-gulp!)... Shofixti were being here today
the shame!... Oh the shame!... it would be unbearable!
(whimper!)... awk!

#(whats_up_space_4)
Aren't you just slaves to the Ur-Quan?

#(GENERAL_INFO_SPACE_4)	yehat-017.ogg
NO!  WE ARE NOT SLAVES!! WE ARE!... We are!... we are...
Battle Thralls.

#(i_demand_you_ally_space)
By your honor, Yehat captain, I, <% state.sis.getCaptainName() %>, master of the <% state.sis.getShipName() %>, in the name of <% comm.getPhrase("name_" .. (state.prop.get("NEW_ALLIANCE_NAME") + 1)) %> call upon the Starship Clans to honor their word and fight for our cause!

#(WE_CANNOT_1)	yehat-018.ogg
As much as my heart cries to aid ye, valiant human, I cannot!
Each of us is sworn first to our Queen who
has commanded us to treat ye as an enemy of the Crown!

#(obligation)
Your species' obligation cannot simply be forgotten! What about your honor, your pride!?

#(WE_CANNOT_2)	yehat-019.ogg
Can't ye see that ye are killing me human?
The shame!... the awful shame of it!
What ye say is true, we SHOULD be under the same wing
but DAMN YER EYES!... our Queen has given the Ur-Quan our allegiance
and there is nothing I can be doing about it now!

#(at_least_help_us_space)
At least help us with materials for our struggle!

#(SORRY_CANNOT)	yehat-020.ogg
We cannot!
To be doing so would be a direct violation of our royal Queen's commands!

#(dishonor)
Think Yehat. The sheer dishonor of it all.

#(HERES_A_HINT)	yehat-021.ogg
We cannot be giving ye material aid, Captain.
But perhaps ye can make use of this information, Captain.
When we were fighting the Great War against the Mycons
we encountered a number of odd worlds which seemed to be having their crust shattered.
Molten lava ran across the surface in huge rivers, and dense metallic elements were abundant.
But the strangest world we found was the first planet at the star at coordinates 639.5 : 231.2.
The Mycons were guarding this planet with an almost limitless number of their Podships
as though there were something of great value there.
We could never break through their forces, though we destroyed scores of their ships.
Perhaps, if ye fare better than us, or can somehow trick the Mycons to let ye land
you may discover this secret, and it may help ye in yer quest.

#(what_about_pkunk_space)
Tell us about the Pkunk.

#(PKUNK_ABSORBED_SPACE)	yehat-022.ogg
This is a matter for the Yehat, human, and ONLY for the Yehat.
The Pkunk have been absorbed... and that is being the end of it.
Do not ask further about this matter.

#(HATE_PKUNK_SPACE)	yehat-023.ogg
You have met them!?? The wretched creatures are alive?!!
You should be telling us where they are, Captain!
Tell us so that we can be correcting the mistake made a thousand years ago
when we permitted the Pkunk to leave our Nest alive.
By all rights, we should have eliminated the craven cowards down to the last bird!

#(bye_space)
Goodbye Yehat... our allies and friends.

#(GO_IN_PEACE)	yehat-024.ogg
Though honoring our past commitment we are not,
we will be letting you go in peace.

#(GOODBYE_AND_DIE_SPACE)	yehat-025.ogg
You are causing us sorrow, human, sorrow indeed,
because now we must obey the commands of our Queen and destroy you.

#(shofixti_alive_1)
This may come as a shock, but the Shofixti are reborn.

#(shofixti_alive_2)
We have a Shofixti Captain here with us. Now do you believe?

#(SEND_HIM_OVER_1)	yehat-026.ogg
If this is being a true thing, there will be many changes.
But we are a species long wise in the ways of deceit.
Ye must be proving these words ye say, Captain.
Send the Shofixti to us as a way of proof.

#(SEND_HIM_OVER_2)	yehat-027.ogg
Ye are lying to us once, Captain. Now we need the hard evidence.
Order yer supposed Shofixti to come to us, Captain.

#(not_here)
Well I don't have one right HERE.

#(not_send)
I will not subject one of my officers to such danger. How do I know you won't just kill him?

#(JUST_A_TRICK_1)	yehat-028.ogg
It is a trick then, isn't it! And nothing more.
Human, we have been patient with ye up to this point, but now ye have gone too far.
Ye have most skillfully rubbed the salt into our wounds, and ye shall pay fer it in blood!

#(JUST_A_TRICK_2)	yehat-029.ogg
Another TRICK!
Yer lying tongue has doomed ye!

#(ok_send)
All right, I'll send over the Shofixti... but don't mess with him, okay?

#(WE_REVOLT)	yehat-030.ogg
We are scanning the separation of a vessel from yer fleet, Captain
and indeed, its configuration matches that of a Shofixti Scout vessel.
This had better not be a trick, Captain!
We are knowing the power of a Glory Device, and if you detonate the weapon near us
the price for you shall be dear, very dear.
The Scout has docked, and we await the pilot's appearance at the airlock.
The atmosphere cycle is complete... the door slides open... and
IT IS TRUE!!! THE SHOFIXTI ARE ALIVE!!!
Look at that furred muzzle, those shining black eyes, the sweet claws!
Our children have returned from oblivion!!
But now we are faced with the cruellest truth!...
...We who have sacrificed our honor! We who have lain with the enemy!
WE ARE NOT WORTHY! WE ARE NOTHING!...We are less than nothing.
But wait! We are not Spathi. We are Yehat... OF THE STARSHIP CLANS!
We will NOT live this lie any longer!
Listen as I speak these words! If our Queen makes the dishonorable command
then it is THE QUEEN WHO HAS NO HONOR!
And a dishonorable Queen is NO QUEEN AT ALL!
We, the Zeep-Zeep, are the only Clan who remember the TRUE MEANING of honor
we shall TEAR THE QUEEN FROM HER THRONE!
The two-thousand year reign of the Veep-Neep Queens IS OVER!
THE REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN!

#(ROYALIST_SPACE_HELLO_1)	yehat-031.ogg
Human... ye shall never be fully comprehending the damage you are doing now to our Yehat culture.
For fully TWO THOUSAND YEARS there has been peace between the Clans!...
...and now you have cast the ancient seed of dissension between our beaks!
The bloody Wars of Ascension are renewed, and YOU are the cause, Captain!
While the Zeep-Zeep traitors may be your allies, Captain
I can be assuring you that we, of the Feep-Eeep Starship Clan
are wanting nothing more dearly than your death!

#(ROYALIST_SPACE_HELLO_2)	yehat-032.ogg
It is the human Agitator who would see Her Radiant Majesty pulled from the High Perch!
Ye will rue the day ye devised this wicked scheme!

#(ROYALIST_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_1)	yehat-033.ogg
Human! Like all heroes, ye be as brainless as ye are brave.
Do ye not know, that here there be none of the traitorous Zeep-Zeep Starship Clans!
Ye are as good as dead, human.

#(ROYALIST_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_2)	yehat-034.ogg
Cease yer bloody taunting, human!
Ye dance like a sick breeg, never engaging us in battle-to-the-death
as honor and true courage are demanding!

#(how_is_rebellion)
So, how's the revolution going for you guys?

#(ROYALIST_REBELLION_1)	yehat-035.ogg
Revolution!? Ye compliment yerself unnecessarily, Captain.
This is nothing more than a... band of thugs trying to undo the peace of a hundred generations!
We will roast the traitors in their ships, and crack the eggs in their Clanhome
so that never again will the Zeep-Zeep criminals be flying though our stars.

#(ROYALIST_REBELLION_2)	yehat-036.ogg
Do not be worrying yerself, Captain! Victory is almost within our grasp.

#(sorry_about_revolution)
Gosh, I'm sorry about this revolution thing. I didn't mean any harm.

#(ALL_YOUR_FAULT)	yehat-037.ogg
The pain and suffering of this useless conflict are being nothing but a tragic waste of life.
Congratulate yourself, Captain. The source of all this death and misery is yerself.

#(bye_royalist)
Goodbye Royalist fool!

#(GOODBYE_AND_DIE_ROYALIST)	yehat-038.ogg
Now ye must pay fer yer crimes, human!

So, I suppose you are wondering what I'm doing at this control console
well, I guess I can tell you now.
I'm writing a screenplay!
It's an existential thriller!
Kind of a cross between a Woody Allen angst-fest mixed with some of Tobe Hooper's best work.
But actually, this is just my way of getting my wing in the door, you see
what I really want to do is DIRECT!

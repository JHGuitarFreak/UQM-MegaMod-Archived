This file tries to organize and describe the changes between releases.
Changes are broadly classified into the following categories:

- New Features: These are either elements of the original games that
  were first implemented in this release, or actually new capabilities
  that are visible to the user.

- Bugfixes: The removal of visible Bad Things from the code.

- Internal Changes: The removal of invisible Bad Things from the code,
  or changes in the way the program itself is structured.  These are
  unlikely to be of interest to you unless you plan on coding
  extensions.

			     Version 0.7
			    -------------

- Gas giants can no longer have negative masses

INTERNAL CHANGES

- Code cleanup; many warnings removed

  mostly interesting in that 3DO voices, 3DO videos, and 3DO music
  are now addon packs like any other.
- Code reorganization; old stuff removed, new stuff better set-up
- 32-bit graphics everywhere internally.
- Refactored universe generation

			     Version 0.6
			    -------------

NEW FEATURES

- Netplay!  You can now engage in Super Melee over the Internet.
- Key configuration is now entirely in-game.
- UQM now compiles and runs on 64-bit systems.

BUGFIXES

- The Quit button (F10) now works properly when used during the
  introduction sequence.
- Various small fixes to text and conversation logic.

INTERNAL CHANGES

- The setup menu now reads all its text from the content, easing
  translation.
- The MOD player for PC-style music can now be linked against an
  external version of libmikmod.
- Various code cleanups and memory optimizations.

			     Version 0.5
			    -------------

NEW FEATURES

- The Starmap is searchable!  Type / then the beginning of the
  constellation name, and you can tab through all possible
  completions.
- New 'hq' scaler, based on Maxim Stepin's "HQ2X" scaler.  See
  www.hiend3d.com/hq2x.html for more details.
- Scalers can use MMX/SSE/3DNow! instructions for significant speed
  improvements.  The "Processor pack" is necessary for compilation of
  same on VC6.
- Imported DOS versions of many graphics; these have richer palettes
  and so generally look better
- There's a proper credit roll at the end of the game now.
- Superior Planet handling: topographical maps scaled far more
  precisely; optional 3DO-style throbbing slave shield; planets are
  finally rotating spheres instead of spotlit cylinders or rectangles.
  The old PC-style "Entering Planetary Orbit..." screen is back.
- Setup Menu far more complete and easy to use, and selections made in
  the Setup Menu will actually persist when you restart the program
- Added support for the Tremor Ogg Vorbis decoder (avoids floating point
  math)
- Home, End and BackSpace keys work as you'd expect in text input.
- Most of the game works with Unicode properly now, and so, with proper
  font characters installed, will work with non-Latin alphabets.  (On
  Windows, Unicode input requires a very recent version of SDL.)
- Text may be input with the joystick again, as on the 3DO.  The
  available characters are stored in content/lbm/joyalpha.txt.
- The intro now plays only when a new game is started.
- Color depth is now determined entirely automatically.

BUGFIXES

- Only SELECT and CANCEL trigger the fade-to-black at the end of a
  Super Melee, solving the issue of invisible "Really Quit?" menus for
  Super Melee.  The "quit during fades" problem in general is still
  extant.
- Many dialog, and comm animation, and general graphical fixes
- Keypress status is not reset when entering battle mode, so (for
  instance) Melnorme ships can continue to charge a shot across
  battles.
- The Melnorme would occasionally strip off Plot Points as part of a
  fuel deal.  No longer.
- Bugs in the original code prevented certain ships from properly
  spawning in "uncontrolled" space.  The "wilds" are now a bit wilder,
  as apparently originally intended.
- Venus's atmospheric density was incorrectly corrected in the 3DO
  version.  It's been correctly corrected now.
- Scheduled plot events work properly, even when the game suddenly
  skips ahead in time.
- Fixed version checking in unix build scripts. SDL 1.2.10 is now
  recognised as newer than 1.2.9.
- Spliced communications can be safely skipped past now.
- Fixed fast escape weirdness (bug #619)
- Threading system no longer assumes that there is no thread 0; this
  permits compilation on AmigaOS.
- Relative paths and fallback paths work properly now.
- Scalers now use surface pitch instead of image width - this is
  reported to solve many strange display problems in non-OpenGL mode
  on Macs
- Ending sequences may now be safely paused.

INTERNAL CHANGES

- Added the rest of devel/ and users/ documentation into MSVC .dsp
  files.
- Control scheme upgraded.  Old versions of keys.cfg will no longer
  work.
- PNG transparency info (tRNS chunk) is now set properly, based on
  info in the .ani files.
- Paletted images should render much faster now, and collisions
  between mods are less likely.
- New font engine: fonts are loaded and treated as alpha-channel-only
  images, with font effects handled as backing images.
- Melee works properly with alpha-channel graphics new, even when
  mipmapped.
- Lander report drawing handled more sensibly now
- Binary resource indexes have been replaced with textual ones.
- All spritework is done internally in 32BPP.
- Removed MikMod i/o hacks.
- The temp files for representing star and group data are now kept in
  memory instead.
- Separate config_win.h file for build.sh builds on Windows
- Lowered some animation rates to reasonable levels, lowering CPU
  usage.
- Changed comm subtitle caching scheme.  Should kill the "blue comm
  screen" problem forever.
- Refactored setup menu code to use generic widgets.
- Cleaner build output. Set '$MAKE_VERBOSE' to 1 for old output.
- Improved dependency tracking for unix build system. "./build.sh uqm
  depend" is now only needed for checking for new source files.

			     Version 0.4
			    -------------

NEW FEATURES

- Setup menu now permits configuration of some options.  They do not
  yet persist past program quit, though.
- Added a "--version" option
- Melee images are now based on the (richer) DOS content
- 3-step melee zooming as per the PC version is now implemented
- It is now possible to complete the game without ever allying with the
  Starbase (if one is insane; this is known on the forum as "Beating The
  Game Differently" - but bugs and plot elements preventing this have been
  fixed or evaded under this circumstance).

BUGFIXES

  joystick is not present
- Music volume normalized throughout the game

INTERNAL CHANGES

- Thread system completely reworked to provide more detailed thread
  information, and to prevent resource leaks

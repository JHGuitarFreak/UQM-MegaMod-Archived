This document describes the installation procedure for a installation from
source on a Linux or BSD platform.

1.
First, make sure all the required libraries are installed.
They are listed in the file INSTALL in the top dir.


2.
If you haven't done so already, download the content .uqm files packages
that you want, from where you got this source package.
You'll need uqm-0.7.0-content.uqm; uqm-0.7.0-3domusic.uqm (music from the 3DO
version) and uqm-0.7.0-voice.uqm (spoken alien dialogs) are optional.

Put the uqm-0.7.0-content.uqm in the directory content/packages/ which exists
in the top directory of the source tree (the dir with (among others)
COPYING, src/, and build.var.in).
Put the optional music and voice packages in the content/addons/ directory.


3.
Run './build.sh uqm'
Change settings in the menu if you want.
The source building process will start, and when it ends, you should have
a file 'uqm' in the source dir (or uqm-debug if you selected a debug build).
You can try it out from this dir by typing './uqm' (or './uqm-debug').


4.
Run './build.sh uqm install', and be patient.
Depending on what installation location you selected in the configuration
menu, you might need root permissions here.


5.
Done.
You can start the game now with the command 'uqm'.
You may also delete the source (with the .uqm files you put in
content/) if you want.


If you want to recompile with other options, you can use
'./build.sh uqm config' to reconfigure; you might need to do
'./build.sh uqm depend' afterwards.

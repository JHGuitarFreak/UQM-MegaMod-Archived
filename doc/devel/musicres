This is the format for resources of type MUSICRES (these have the extension
.mod in the original source).

If the first 3 characters are 'CDA', from the next character to the first
nul char, or 3 characters after the first period (whatever comes first) is
used as a filename with aif audio data to play. (CDA stands for CD-audio.
The source code mentions 'red book', but it's not (red book is the standard
for audio CD's)). The rest of the file (just a few more chars) seems to be
garbage.

If the first 3 characters are something else, the entire file (including the
first 3 characters) are used as a MOD file. (As the mod file uses those char
as the title of the song, a mod file with the title beginning with 'CDA'
will go wrong).

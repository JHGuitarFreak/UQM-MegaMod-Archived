This file contains notes about considerations for developing a live CD
for UQM.


Information on creating boot CD's:
- http://www.geocities.com/potato.geo/bootlinuxcd.html
- man mkisofs
- http://linuxfromscratch.org/~jhuntwork/livecd/
- http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bootdisk-HOWTO/


Desirable features:
- Both Linux native mode (when booting directly from the CD),
  an MS Windows autorun. And perhaps even MacOS boot.
- install from the CD (for Windows)
- Support saving


- Needed software:
  - boot loader
    syslinux: ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/
  - init (simpleinit?)
  - libc (including libpthread) (uClibc)?
  - libSDL
  - libSDL_image
  - libpng (needed for libSDL_image)
  - libvorbisfile
  - libvorbis (for libvorbisfile)
  - libogg (for libvorbis)
  - libmikmod
  - libm (for libvorbis)
  - libz (for zipped content)
  - syslogd+klogd?

  Some audio library:
  - libasound (prefered)

  Some graphics output: one of
  - x11 (larger than necessary)
  - nanox
  - fbcon (may be the best solution)
  - directfb
  - svgalib (directly accesses the VGA card. No acceleration support)
    (may be the most portable)
  Having hardware acceleration support may be useful.

  For basic debugging:
  - sulogin
  - sash or busybox (minimal features)

  For hardware detection:
  - udev
  - ...

- Other needed files:
  - boot scripts
  - /etc/ld.so.conf
  - ...

- Sources
  Sources must be provided in some way (check the licenses of the
  dependencies).

- Warranty disclaimer on boot


For saving:
- USB memory stick and other memory devices
- Windows hard drive (where to put the files?)
- Linux hard drive (where to put the files?)
- Floppies? Probably not worth it.



Tools for testing before burning:
- vmware
- QEMU (http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/)

This file is intended as a place to document historically interesting
curiosities in the UQM source and content, which have been deleted from
the current source/content tree.

This file is probably not complete.


== .res files ===

The Star Control source code contained files with the extension .res, which
contained a description of the packages (.pkg or .ndx) files to be generated.

There were .res files for each ship and each race which you can communicate
with. These files 'included' the file 'star3do.res', which itself included
'star3do.typ'.

There were also header files icode.h, igfxres.h, imusicre.h, isndres.h,
istrtab.h, resinst.h, respkg.h and restypes.h in each of the ship and comm
directories, which defined a few resource constants, which were presumably also
generated from these .res files.


== Outtake not taken out ==

There was an outtake accidentally left in the original speech for the Druuge.
It can still be found at
	http://sc2.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/sc2/trunk/sc2/content/comm/druuge/druug011.ogg?revision=133&pathrev=1113


== Original title screen and menu ==

The original title screen -- which included the text 'Star Control' and
'Accolade' and could hence not be used in UQM -- can be found at
        http://sc2.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sc2/trunk/sc2/content/lbm/title.tga?revision=6&pathrev=6
The original main menu (which did not include 'setup' or 'quit' options)
can be found at
        http://sc2.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sc2/trunk/sc2/content/lbm/newgame0.tga?revision=6&pathrev=6

# The Ur-Quan Masters MegaMod
A fork of The Ur-Quan Masters with added options, cheats, enhancements, and other modifications.

## Changes from the original

A full list of changes and features can be found on either the [Sourceforge mother-site](http://uqm-mods.sourceforge.net/Features) or the [Github daughter-site](https://serosis.github.io/#Features)

The newest major change as of 22nd Nov 2017 is that the Classic MegaMod is now built on version 0.8.0 from the official SVN.

## Motivation

This project exists out of my love for Star Control II and The Ur-Quan Masters project. Fiddling with the code as a hobby to try and expand my skill as a programmer.

## Windows Installation

Unzip the Windows-0.8.0.zip to a folder of your choosing. One does not need to have UQM already installed, the ZIP comes with all the files necessary to run the game.

## MacOS X Installation

Mount the .dmg file and copy the app to your Applications folder.

## Content Installation

When building from source you will need the respective sero-setup content file in the addons folder depending on which version you are building. You can grab this file on either the [Sourceforge mother-site](http://uqm-mods.sourceforge.net/Releases) or the [Github daughter-site](https://serosis.github.io/#Releases) under Sero Menu.

## Contributors

Me for right now, possibly more coming soon.

# The Ur-Quan Masters MegaMod
A fork of The Ur-Quan Masters with added options, cheats, enhancements, and other modifications.

## Changes from the original

A full list of changes and features can be found on either the [Sourceforge mother-site](http://uqm-mods.sourceforge.net/Features) or the [Github daughter-site](https://serosis.github.io/#Features)

The newest major change as of April 17th 2017 is the addition of an in-game menu for all of the cheats.

## Options (Cheats and fun stuff)

* --kohrstahp / kohrStahp
  * Stops the Kohr-Ah from advancing.
* --godmode / godMode
  * Self explanatory, also refills your ship energy every time you fire your weapon in melee. Only works against computer controlled oppenents. The land-on-spot portion of the Lander Mods cheat was moved here.
* --timedilation / timeDilation
  * Slows down time or speeds up time depending on the option
  * 0 = Normal game clock - IP = 30 seconds | HS = 5 seconds

* --unlockships / unlockShips
  * Unlocks all ships for the shipyard.

  * Enables the Crystal Dynamics logo and 3DO commercial when using the 3DO videos

## Motivation

This project exists out of my love for Star Control II and The Ur-Quan Masters project. Fiddling with the code as a hobby to try and expand my skill as a programmer.

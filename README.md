# The Ur-Quan Masters MegaMod
A fork of The Ur-Quan Masters with added options, cheats, enhancements, and other modifications.

## Changes from the original

A full list of changes and features can be found on either the [Sourceforge mother-site](http://uqm-mods.sourceforge.net/Features) or the [Github daughter-site](https://serosis.github.io/#Features)

The newest major change as of the 1st of Jan 2018 is that the MegaMod is now built on version 0.8.0 from the official Git.

## Motivation

This project exists out of my love for Star Control II and The Ur-Quan Masters project. Fiddling with the code as a hobby to try and expand my skill as a programmer.

## Windows Installation

Open up the installer, pick your optional content, wait for all of it to download and install, then play!

## MacOS X Installation

Mount the .dmg file and copy the app to your Applications folder.

## Building Yourself

When building from source you will need the respective uqm-0.8.0-content.uqm file in the packages folder. You can grab this file on  [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/uqm-mods/files/MegaMod/uqm-0.8.0-content.uqm).

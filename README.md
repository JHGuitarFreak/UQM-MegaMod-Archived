# The Ur-Quan Masters MegaMod
A fork of The Ur-Quan Masters that continues the HD mod with a veritable smorgasbord of extra features.

## Changes from the original

A full list of changes and features can be found on the [Main site](http://megamod.serosis.net/Features).

And the current changelog can be found in the repository: [Changelog](https://github.com/Serosis/UQM-MegaMod/blob/master/MegaMod%20Changelog.txt)

## Motivation

This project exists out of my love for Star Control II and The Ur-Quan Masters project. Fiddling with the code as a hobby to try and expand my skill as a programmer.

## Windows Installation

Open up the installer, pick your optional content, wait for all of it to download and install, then play!

## MacOS X Installation

Mount the .dmg file and copy the app to your Applications folder.

## Building Yourself

I've made the process super easy for Windows, as long as you have either Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2019. Just load up the solution file and compile away.

For other platforms you'll have to gather all of the necessary dependencies and hope for the best.

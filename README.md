# The Ur-Quan Masters HD Mega Mod
A fork of The Ur-Quan Masters HD with added options, cheats, enhancements, and other modifications.

## Changes from the original

You can now keep your alliance with the Thraddash so long as you do not try to steal their Aqua Helix during any of the times that it is completely unprotected. The only time that you can pick up the Aqua Helix without angering the Thraddash is if you're allied with them and you ask politely to go to the planet's surface containing the Helix.

Save heap size has been changed to 32kB. This allows you to practically mine out every star system and save without crashing the game.

Maximum saves upped to 100. Personal request.

/* This file contains some compile-time configuration options for MS Windows
 * systems when building using build.sh (MinGW, Cygwin).
 * config_win.h is generated from src/config_win.h.in by build.sh
 * For building using MSVC, you'll have to edit src/config_vc6.h manually
 * if you want anything else than the defaults.
 * For *nix systems, config_unix.h is used, which is generated by build.sh
 * from src/config_unix.h.in.

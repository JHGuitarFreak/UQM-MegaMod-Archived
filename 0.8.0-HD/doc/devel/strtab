This is the format for resources of type STRTAB. It contains a number of
items of unspecified data (not necessarilly strings).
This is used for game strings (extension .txt), colour tables (.ct),
colour translation tables (.xlt), and sound-effect tables (.snd)

Everything is stored MSB first unless otherwise specified.

position   length  meaning
           4       0xffffffff if the file is uncompressed.
                   Otherwise, the file is compressed. When uncompressed, the
                   file complies with the rest of the format as described
                   below.
           2       Unused in file, always 0x0000
           2       number of items in the file (StringCount)

Followed by:
  In file:
           4       Placeholder, always 0x00000000
    numitems times:
           4       length of string
  In memory:
    numitems times:
           4       offset from &StringCount to the string
    followed by:
           4       offset from &StringCount until one char past the end
                   of the last string.

For .ct files an item is as follows (new 256x24bit format):
           1       Index of first clut in this item.
           1       Index of last clut in this item.
  For each clut:
    256 palette entries:
           1       red value
           1       green value
           1       blue value

For old .ct files an item is as follows (obsoleted by new 256x24bit format):
           1       Index of first clut in this item.
           1       Index of last clut in this item.
  For each clut:
    32 palette entries:
           2       bits 0-4: blue value
                   bits 5-9: green value
                   bits 10-14: red value
                   bit  15: specifies the interpolation mode for 3DO scaling
                            (is ignored now)
The full palette contains 256 values, which are the original 32 values
    multiplied by 1 to 8.


For .ct files (planet surface version; in ipanims) an item is as follows:
           1       Index of first color in this colortab.
           1       Index of last color in this colortab.
  Then for each color (6 bits per channel):
           1       bits 0-5: red value
           1       bits 0-5: green value
           1       bits 0-5: blue value
The planet surface palette files were probably copied verbatim from DOS version
and left alone because they do no exactly fit into the whole CLUT system.

For .xlt files (planet surface; in ipanims) an item is as follows:
           2*3     3 elevation levels (not used, probably informational)
           1*256   256 colormap indices each corresponding to a particular
                   elevation level 0..255; only colormap indices 128..255
                   can be used currently because colormaps only define
                   colors 128..255
The .xlt files combined with planet surface .ct files are used to select colors
for planet surface rendering.


For .snd files an item is as follows:
           N-2     Signed, 8-bit, 1 channel PCM samples of the sound
                   effect, where N = (length of string)
           2       Sampling frequency of the sound, *LSB first*
                   (the frequencies themselves seem to be remnants of
                    the DOS version)

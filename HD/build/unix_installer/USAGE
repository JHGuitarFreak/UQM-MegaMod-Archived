Making a release binary:

- Build the game in release mode.

- Change build/unix_installer/template to suit your needs.

- From the 'sc2' dir of the svn tree, run the following command, changing
  the arguments if necessary.
  The first one is the name of the final executable, the second
  the template to use.

  	build/unix_installer/buildinstaller.sh uqm-0.2-linux-dynamic.sh \
  			"build/unix_installer/template"

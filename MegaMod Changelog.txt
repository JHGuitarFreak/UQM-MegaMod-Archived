# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [Ideas]
- Create an "Ironman" setting and save system
- Add "Gameplay options" to options menu to toggle Hard Mode options for normal and easy gameplay
- HARD MODE: Ur-Quan can show up anywhere on the map, not just in their SOI. Kzer-Za would be more prevalent while Kohr-Ah would be more rare.
- HARD MODE: Can only build two of any ship
- HARD MODE: Tanaka/Katana can fight back
- HARD MODE: Mineral types aren't revealed on the scan
- HARD MODE: Life form location does not show up on a scan
- HARD MODE: Melnrome tech is limited so you can't build an overpowered flagship
- HARD MODE: Selling any amount of crew to the Druuge immediately guarantees a hike in crew cost and the Commander's disapproval
- HARD MODE: If you don't take care of the Probes before a year passes they spawn at a 100% rate
- EASY MODE: Have the Commander tell you about the Melnorme earlier than usual
- EASY MODE: Have the commander tell you about the ZFP earlier
- EASY MODE: life forms can be picked up without stunning them
- EASY MODE: Some modules are built in to the ship, like autotracking. Adding more just enhances the effect
- EASY MODE: Start off with more fuel
- EASY MODE: start off with more RU

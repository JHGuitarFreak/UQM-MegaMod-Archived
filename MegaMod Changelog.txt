# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [Ideas]
- HARD MODE: Ur-Quan can show up anywhere on the map, not just in their SOI. Kzer-Za would be more prevalent while Kohr-Ah would be more rare.
- HARD MODE: Melnrome tech is limited so you can't build an overpowered flagship
- HARD MODE: If you don't take care of the Probes before a year passes they spawn at a 100% rate
